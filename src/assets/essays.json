      "essay": "Robotics allowed me to discover fragments of myself hidden within the sand dunes of my life circumstances. As I look back into my childhood, I realize that opportunities for cultivating passions were few and far between. I lacked the guidance that so many of my peers were fortunate enough to have. Yet, I too was fortunate. When I was given the transportation to participate in school activities, FIRST Robotics was the first thing that popped up on my radar. \n\nOver the past three years, my robotics team has given me some of my closest friends. They’ve taught me about who I am as a person and helped me grow and discover my passions. The introduction into electrical and mechanical engineering I got made me realize that even though I love computer science, I can’t limit myself to a singular field. All the opportunities that no one ever told me about such as research and internships were made known to me. Up until this point I had been stumbling into my passions without purposeful direction.\n\n Also, I learned just how much I love to mentor others when I would walk around participating in the different groups, chiming in and explaining different concepts.

      "essay": "After boarding a Harbor Tour at the Port of Long Beach, what was once the fresh smell of seawater quickly transformed into the rotten smell of decayed eggs. As the nauseating odor wafted towards me, ambiguous thoughts confronted me: What is this stench? What exactly is causing it? This obscure predicament ultimately spurred my passion and curiosity for marine conservation research (MCR). To further this passion, I joined the Hawksbill sea turtle conservation research group at UC Santa Cruz's Science Internship Program. In joining this team, I was able to further my MCR interest at the species level. From the inspirational conversations I had with my sixth-year graduate student mentor about the tagging and mapping process of sea turtles to the Google Maps tours my fellow intern and I gave each other of our respective neighborhoods, I not only gained a new understanding of the scientific world outside my city bubble but also gained a new appreciation for my local community's academic diversity and determination. The research feasibility limitations of today's climate have inspired me to search my local community for these opportunities. While species-level inquiries within MCR are most popular, many overlook unconventional methods--my evaluation study on the effectiveness of the Aquarium's new Ocean Neighbors program for my AP Research class. In finding myself beside like-minded individuals, I obtained new-found confidence and strength, allowing me to flourish in this collaborative academic environment where sharing one's thoughts is both encouraged and praised. Before these societal constraints, my supervisor tasked me with assembling a mock abalone release crate for one of the Aquarium's exhibit-interpretation stations. With a limited amount of resources at my disposal, I learned the importance of strategizing beforehand. Instead of carelessly using a hand saw and hot gluing the pipes together, I created drafts upon drafts of sketches, detailing the measurement and placement of each straggling piece of kelp and each hand-made clay abalone. Hence, this intellectual journey allowed me to enhance my creativity in painting the rocky California substrate and finding unconventional solutions to any problems. It turns out that the rotten egg smell comes from hydrogen sulfide, a hazardous chemical that can arise from rotting organic matter--including seaweed, algae blooms, and deceased fish. Yet, research is neverending; it presents even more questions - that is why I love it. With a Cornell postsecondary education, I hope to search for these questions to further the scientific field of biological sciences. With a concentration in marine biology, studying at Cornell will allow me to immerse myself in marine science both on-campus at Professor Harvell's Marine Ecosystem and Sustainability course--a CALS faculty member who helped place the Sunflower sea star on the IUCN Red List - and off-campus at the Shoals Marine Laboratory - a remote island field station in the Gulf of Maine. Having over 30 minors, CALS would also allow me to pursue interests in other fields of study, such as climate change. Within this minor, the Climate, Archaeology, and History course demonstrates CALS strength in the humanities while the Business and Economics of Energy course displays similar depth in the social sciences--thereby providing students similar academic flexibility to those in the College of Arts and Sciences. As a federal land grant institution in New York state, CALS gears towards giving back to humanity. Through civic engagement in my local community, I have made similar strides. According to the City of Long Beach, \"residents and businesses throw away approximately 368,000 tons of residential, commercial, and industrial waste\"--that is 1,494 pounds for each 450,000+ individual! For this reason, I helped initiate sustainability workshops throughout our community to help counteract this crisis. Aiming to continue my academic journey to graduate school and beyond, I aspire to have as much an impact on the state, national, and global scale. To me, civic engagement means solving prominent issues facing society--by oneself or, even better, alongside others. Collaboration reaps the ultimate benefits!",

      "essay": "“You had to live-did live, from habit that became instinct-in the assumption that every sound you made was overheard, and, except in darkness, every movement scrutinized” -George Orwell, 1984. This quote from the third page essentially grabbed my attention and propelled me through the rest of the book when I started reading it over the summer. And when I took the time-well, several times, actually-I couldn’t dispute the natural truth that was found in these few words. For in 1984 and in 2014, I really started to make the connections on how it seems that the world has the potential to monitor you daily.\n\nThis led me to the idea that within the world, people need to become more focused on what they think about themselves, and not what the world thinks about you. Everywhere you turn, it seems like someone is watching you. Edward Snowden revealed to us how the government is spying on us for national security reasons. But it’s not just that. A majority of people are constantly engaged in social media outlets, with their thumbs blistering from many tweets. And thanks to the limitless transfer of information across the internet, people you will never meet could always be monitoring you. While that extreme would likely not be thought about, the cyberbullying resulting from this is all too real. Too many people live in fear of this shadow hanging over their head, so they become trapped liked caged mice. But it’s this exact reason why people need to become re-focused on themselves: If the whole world is watching, your show, shouldn’t you decided what goes on in it?\n\nAnother insight that I gained from this quote as it pertains to the world is in relation to the perceived idea of success. According to Orwell, everyone is always watching and judging you. So now I took a reflexive look at how our top students are perceived at my high school. These people (myself included) are constantly judged-sometimes positively, sometimes negatively- by the open successes that we have. So it appears that no matter what the case is, students are continually comparing, criticising, and degrading themselves brd on others accomplishments; they don’t feel that their own accomplishments “match up” or are worthy enough. I have seen many other supporting examples from my own life that corroborates my conclusion. The same phenomenon occurred with a few of my college attending friends from listening to their stories. Also, when I would go shopping at local stores, my friends that work there would be agitated by other people getting the employees of the month award, despite their own personal merits. While I try to be mindful of causal proof in these observances, the coincidence repeats too often for me to ignore it.\nWith these beliefs in my mind, I now choose to approach the world in a more respectful and open manner. I don’t want to be subjected to these criticisms for any negative actions, but it seems that criticism is inevitable. So now I have become more conscious of the world around me, and I want to be more mindful of people. I learned that my privacy is paper thin, and the same goes for other people. Therefore, my metacognition has revolved around being flexible to the world around me. Think before you act; be open-minded of others; give everyone a fair chance. These are a few mottos that I have learned to adopt over time, and I do my best to follow them.\n\nSo all in all, my approach to the world has been positively changed by these experiences. Now, I am able to look past the pond surface and into the cool waters beneath them before I make a decision to swim in them.\n\n",

      "essay": "I have always regarded Joe as one of my musical heroes for working with world renown bands, such as [REDACTED], but he has influenced my life as a mentor, a role model, and a friend these past few years. I met Joe through my music school, the School of Rock, during my sophomore year when I joined the showteam, a team of the best musicians in the school that tour the state. He runs the band through rehearsals each week in preparation for our shows, however, when I first joined, he mentored me not only as a musician, but also through a crippling anxiety that stunted my playing and behavior. I was so nervous and anxious to meet him because I had been listening to his music for years, and I felt sort of starstruck to be learning from him. This anxiety made the first few rehearsals incredibly embarrassing as I constantly made mistakes and shied away from any interaction with the other band members. I was certain Joe would be disappointed or angry with me, however, he was incredibly kind and helped me get through my anxieties by talking to me in and out of rehearsal about the importance of having confidence in one’s self. He also taught me how to maintain a relaxed composure while on stage and during practice. His kindness helped me develop the confidence and composure needed to synergize with the band. Furthermore, his advice and mentoring molded me into the confident musician and person that I am today.\n\nHowever, Joe is also the reason why I’m a leader and teacher at the school today. After a year in showteam, Joe decided that the school needed a student to act as a mentor to all the younger students. I didn’t initially see myself as a possible candidate for the role so when he asked at showteam I immediately balked at the prospect. Joe, however, specifically asked me to fulfill this role as he was confident that I would be a great teacher and role model. At first, I was going to decline, but then remembered my earlier difficulties and how I had matured with Joe’s help. I wanted to help the younger children just as Joe had helped me. Further, the fact that he had so much faith in me empowered me and gave me the courage to accept. His proposal led to my work with the students and volunteering at the school’s summer camps, which, as I discussed in an earlier question, has led me to consider teaching as a career path. Joe’s confidence in me has helped me improve myself as a musician and as a person, and without him, I would never have realized my love of teaching children.\n\n",

      "essay": "I am color blind.\n\nIt happened when I was fifteen.\n\nIt’s not what you think. I can see what color shirt you’re wearing. I can see the color of your eyes. And no, I didn’t bump my head at the bottom of the pool. To elucidate, when I say “color blind,” I’m not referring to my eyes perceiving colors differently from what most humans see. Instead, I refer to my brain perceiving human beings.\n\nBlinded from not just color but essentially any other outside appearance, I allow others to paint their picture in me. Short-circuiting a tendency to judge permits me to genuinely comprehend other people. Certainly, it’s difficult to turn off virulent stereotypes and assumptions; however, the ability to push those fictitious thoughts aside creates an esoteric human who can empathize and sincerely engage with someone.\n\nMy color blindness came into effect during my painting class sophomore year. Tucked away in the back of the classroom sat a girl who wore the same, ominous, black clothing every day—sweater, combat boots, cargo pants, everything. Even her hair was dyed jet black. Previously, I heard rumors from a myriad of students who viewed her as an outcast, an anomaly, and even a “goth girl.” But instead of conforming to their views, I harnessed the courage to sit with her one day.\n\nWith a blank canvas in my hand and in my head, I sparked up a conversation while painting physical and mental outlines. After a few weeks of classes and discussions, her truth was revealed like frost crystallizing on glass, creating something sad yet beautiful. I felt warmth from her genuine feelings and recollections. From her mother passing away just before she moved to a new high school, I uncovered her deepest scars—physical, mental, and emotional. I solved the mystery, not from the traces of fingerprints or a single black footstep, but with my own color blindness.\n\nBut there was light behind her dark. I found out that she was just like anybody else—intelligent, caring, obsessed with Twenty One Pilots, funny, and most importantly, human. During one particular class, I painted a deep blue strawberry with yellow and white seeds on top. Like her, there were unexpected hues. It’s no coincidence that her name is “Stori,” for there are endless chapters in her truth.\n\nWithout my color blindness, I would have never discovered one of my best friends. My mental canvas about her is constantly being filled with more intricate details and rich colors, similar to my actual canvas during our painting class together.\n\nMy cerebral portrait enables me to interact with people’s authentic selves, not just a mere fictitious image in my mind. The tantalizing opinions, stereotypes, and judgments of others do not automatically infiltrate my canvas like splatter paint, though I still hold them to account on my palate.\n\nTrue color originates from the other person, not from me. True color portrays the Truth, not fabricated images and words that society holds. True color equates to empathy, the ability to step into another’s shoes and to truly perceive how one feels.\n\nThis is my story.\n\nNow, what colors are splattered on your canvas about me?\n\n",

Glamorous,  working  in  politics  is  not.  When  the  campaign  office  in  which  I  toiled  for  most  of  my  waking  hours  didn’t  smell  like  dirty  feet,  it  was  due  to  one  of  two  things:  someone  had:\n\nemptied  a  bottle  of  Febreeze  in  a  futile  attempt  at  air  freshening  or  \nopened  one  of  the  mini-­‐fridges  that  were  crammed  with  ancient  leftovers  and  energy  drinks.  \nThe  harsh  overhead  fluorescents  added  to  the  unhealthy  glow  surrounding  even  the  most  defiantly  active/healthy  members  of  the  campaign  staff.

After  working  during  the  early  months  of  the  campaign  as  a  volunteer,  reaching  out  to  party  activists  around  the  district  and  helping  to  build  a  field  program  from  scratch,  the  campaign  hired  me  as  paid  staff  for  the  summer.    This  was,  of  course,  excellent  campaign  strategy.    Whether  I  was  leading  databr  training  over  video  conference  or  traveling  to  and  working  in  Rocky  Mount,  Virginia,  (yes,  it’s  exactly  as  rural  and  charming  as  it  sounds)  for  two  weeks  during  the  dog  days  of  summer,  I  had  opportunities  to  meet  and  work  with  incredibly  dedicated  people  at  every  turn.    \n\n Despite  our  best  efforts  and  great  work,  we  failed.  There’s  really  no  sugar-­‐coating  that  point.  Tuesday,  November  2nd,  was  a  rough  day  for  many  in  Democratic  politics,  to  be  sure.  While  we  were  able  to  find  some  consolation  in  the  nitty-­‐gritty  numbers  (we  out-­‐performed  expectations  in  virtually  all  metrics,  except  in  the  pesky  vote  count),  it  still  didn’t  change  the  fact  that  Tom’s  days  as  the  congressman  from  Virginia’s  5th  district  were  numbered.    \n\n When  the  dust  settled,  and  after  everyone  got  a  few  hours  of  sleep,  the  up-­‐sides  of  losing  became  readily  apparent.  Losing  is  worthless  unless  you  take  the  skills  that  you  honed  in  the  process,  land  on  your  feet,  and  apply  them  to  your  next  adventure.  Tom  Perriello  (occasionally  pronounced  “Per-­‐jell-­‐i-­‐yo”  in  5th  district  vernacular)  is  democracy  building  in  Egypt.  Several  of  my  former  coworkers  are  working  for  the  President  of  the  United  States,  which  is  super  snazzy.  A  couple  went  back  to  college.  Me?  I’m  figuring  it  out.  \n\n",

      "essay": "This summer I flew down to Tuscaloosa, Alabama to attend the University of Alabama Honors Academy. For a week, I lived in the UA Honors College dorms and attended college-level classes and lectures. There were many fascinating lectures, but only one will stay with me for the rest of my life – in a very real sense, it has changed the way I look at the world, and my place and purpose in it.\n\nIt was the morning lecture on the second day of the program –Stephen Black, the Director of the University of Alabama Center for Ethics and Social Responsibility, was the speaker. He began by describing a conversation he once had with the late Millard Fuller, the founder of Habitat for Humanity. Fuller told him that he was proud of his life’s work, but that he was increasingly concerned with the success and legacy of his organization. “How could you be?” Mr. Black asked. “Habitat for Humanity has helped millions of people. It’s one of the most successful charities in the world.”\n\n“It’s true that we’ve helped a lot of folks,” Fuller replied. “We’ve helped over four million people build homes over the years. But since I founded this organization in 1976, the rate of homelessness in America has increased, not decreased. Fewer people own homes now than they did then, and more people are living on the street. How can we look at that and say that we’ve been truly successful?”\n\nMr. Black looked around the room. “You know,” he said, “your generation is the most charitable, most service-oriented generation in history. No American generation has ever been so enthusiastic about volunteer work and community service … But the fact is, in today’s world, that’s just not enough. I hope that your generation can avoid making the same mistake that other generations have made – mistaking sympathy for empathy. And that starts with each of you as individuals.”\n\nI’ve been turning that thought over in my mind ever since. Ours is the most sympathetic generation in history, but at the same time it is among the least empathetic. Sympathy identifies a problem. Empathy compels us to demand a solution. Sympathy eases pain. Empathy demands an end to pain. In the same way, charity treats the symptoms of a profound illness in society, but true empathy demands something greater. When we realize that the Third World is also part of our world, that “those poor children” are our children, that violence, poverty, and injustice are too often a result of our own ignorance and our own apathy, then we can no longer merely donate an hour of our time or a few dollars of our money and feel that we have done enough. The world will demand more of us, so we must demand more of ourselves.\n\nI’ve decided to do my part to meet that generational challenge – to understand people rather than feel sorry for them, to solve problems rather than treat symptoms, to act on empathy rather than feel sympathy. Whether I am organizing community service events through NHS, raising funds with the MSHS Nerdfighter Club to help build wells in Ethiopia, or simply trying to act more selflessly and responsibly in my daily life, I always find Mr. Black’s words in the back of my mind. It is easy to feel powerless before such great responsibility – I know that there are many days when I worry that despite all my efforts to the contrary, I will not succeed, that, to borrow from David Mitchell, “my life may amount to nothing more than one drop in a limitless ocean.”\n\n“Yet what is any ocean, but a multitude of drops?”\n\n",

      "essay": "My relationship with music began when I started taking piano lessons on the well-loved Kreutzer upright in my living room. As my repertoire expanded from “Chopsticks” to Chopin, I realized I loved music but was still searching for meaning. I dreamed of finding the source of inspiration that would transform my music from recital to reverie. In ninth grade, I was offered the organist position at a local church. It seemed like a good enough use of my time and musical ability, but the word “organist” conjured up an image of some reclusive,  frumpily-dressed senior citizen swaying back and forth as they filled up a cathedral. I hadn’t realized the sublime appeal of the organ loft   -there’s no other place that my music becomes such an immersive, mesmerizing experience. I’ve participated in my church as long as I can remember, and now I’m blessed to teach a Sunday School class of third- and fourth-graders. Despite these previous exposures, I’d never discovered the and purpose that I feel when I play the opening cadence of the Gloria or the Agnus Dei.\n\nFor the first nine years of my piano studies, only my family was privy to the “melodies” that  I plunked out on my well-loved, Kreutzer upright piano. At the time, music was no more to me than a casual pursuit.  However, in ninth grade, I was offered the organist position at a local church. It seemed like a good enough use of my time and musical ability. but I’d never thought about being an organist before. The word “organist” used to immediately conjure up an image of some reclusive,  frumpily-dressed senior citizen swaying back and forth as they filled up a cathedral.

I’m no stranger to churches: I’ve participated in ny church as long as I can remember, and now I’m blessed to teach a Sunday School class of third- and fourth-graders.

      "essay": "Sometimes, I bring my Klavierbuchlein; other times, I bring the hymnal I received from my parents. In the winter, I bring an extra sweater. More important than what I bring is what I leave behind. As I ascend step by step up the passageway that many others walk by without a second glance, I cross through rays of light that appear to have been scattered  by a kaleidoscope. At the summit of my climb, my feelings of anxiety, frustration, and uncertainty are vanquished as I enter the organ loft -a place where I feel impervious to the outside world and perfectly content.\n\nI’ve played piano for as long as I can remember on the well-loved Kreutzer upright that sits in my living room.  My church congregation has always been an integral part of my life as well. When offered a church organist position in ninth grade the word “organist” immediately conjured up the image of some reclusive, frumpily dressed, senior citizen swaying back and forth filling a cathedral, but it seemed like an intriguing use of my musical ability. It didn’t take long to realize the offer was serendipity.  While I do have some sartorial sense, I soon understood why organists are often hermits, as I too succumbed to endless hours in the organ loft. There is no other place that I can become as immersed in my music or feel as content.  Despite the  deep connection that I’ve always had with music and my faith, I had never before felt  the serenity and purpose that I feel when playing the opening cadence of the Gloria or the Agnus Dei.\n\nThe organ loft is a place where I’m both master and servant. I play hymns in the style that I choose, and get to improvise during communion and other quiet times. I register each manual -sometimes a mellifluous Gemshorn, and other times a triumphant sounding hautbois. Despite these liberties, I have a responsibility to the congregation, to the priest, and to God. Some hymns are intimidating to sing, and therefore must be accompanied with the utmost of care. The priest’s chant tone needs to segue into the Mass parts, so I play a soft cue like a pitch pipe.  The most difficult commitment, though, is the one I make to God as I sit down on the bench and unlock the organ. Am I glorifying God and being the best Christian I can be? Am I helping other people in their crusade to find faith? Will God forgive my wrong notes?\n\nEntering church and climbing to the organ loft is my redeeming catharsis. I play for weddings, and my belief in love and harmony is restored. I provide music for funerals, and I am reminded of just how insignificant my struggles are. Music and faith are the most important tenets of my life, and the organ loft is the intersection of my two guiding disciplines.  I glance down at the congregation and see how my faith and my talents are impacting others, and I know they’re not the only ones being helped.\n\nAs I settle myself on the organ bench, I often reach for the gold-embossed maroon hymnal that was my favorite Christmas gift in 2012. I pause and read the elegant cursive inscription from my father: “May your devotion to God and the organ continue to grow throughout your life. We’re so proud of you.” There are a lot of things that I wish I could have had the time to learn from my father, but the enduring lesson my Dad  passed on is the importance of believing- not only in God, but also in myself. The organ loft is faith and music incarnate. When I play organ, I feel like I’m pleasing God, and continuing to make my Dad proud as well -it makes sense, as the organ loft is that much closer to Heaven.\n\n",

      "essay": "The flickering LED lights began to form into a face of a man when I focused my eyes. The man spoke a ruthless serial killer of the decade who had been arrested in 2004, and my parents shivered at his reaccounting of the case. I curiously tuned in, wondering who he was to speak of such crimes with concrete composure and knowledge. Later, he introduced himself as a profiler named Pyo Chang Won, and I watched the rest of the program by myself without realizing that my parents had left the couch.\n\n \n\nAfter watching the program, I recited the foreign word until it was no longer unfamiliar—”profiler”. I stayed up all-night searching the meaning; my eyes sparkled with the dim light of the monitor as I read the tales of Pyo Chang Won and his Sherlock-like stories. From predicting the future of criminals and knowing the precise vicinity of a killer on the loose, he had saved countless lives; living in communities riddled with crimes in my youth then and even now, I dreamed of working against crimes. However, the traditional path of a lawyer or a police officer only reinforced the three-step cycle of arrest, trial, and jail which continued with no fundamental changes for years; I wanted to work with the psyche of criminals beyond courts and wondered about the inner workings of the mind.\n\n \n\nSuch admiration and interest led me to invest my time in psychology. Combined with working with the likes of the Victim Witness Agency, I decided to pursue psychology as my major for my undergraduate education. Later on, I want to specialize my research and education on behavioral/forensic psychology and eventually branch out to my childhood dream of becoming a criminal profiler. ",

      "essay": "Coding has been my outlet for creative expression since introduced to basic block programming at age nine, but I could truly appreciate the nuances of code after composing this CPU in my CSII class, which followed a curriculum based on my teacher's experience studying CS as a Cornell undergrad. Whether programming a robot that autonomously picks up blocks, an automated garden that waters itself, or even an anthropomorphic pickle that jumps across my screen, I now reflect in astonishment on how each action, at its core, is enabled by minuscule logic gates distributing electrical inputs. Accordingly, I'm intrigued by Cornell's computer science program which allows students to approach CS from a sophisticated understanding of efficient hardware. Through comprehensive classes such as Computer System Organization and Programming, Cornell ensures that I'll be more than just a programmer-I'll develop practical and real world-applicable solutions. The power of CS is amplified when juxtaposed with physics, as the two fields are entirely complementary-studying quantum mechanics will illuminate fundamental underpinnings of efficient hardware, while emerging Al and machine learning technologies will enable me to scan the deepest crevices of space to understand the formation of our universe. As a [Organization Redacted] intern this past summer, I experienced firsthand the exhilaration of studying galaxies and quasars unimaginably far away. Physics was no longer a set of equations and laws confined to a textbook- cosmological redshift and Hubble's Law became real devices for analyzing galaxy evolution and the expansion of the universe. At Cornell, the unique Astronomy Data Science minor is the exact confluence of astronomy and data science that fascinates me. I look forward to taking Modeling, Mining and Machine Learning in Astronomy with Professor James Cordes, where I'll use modern machine learning techniques to probe questions surrounding human existence. I'm also enthusiastic about conducting research with Prof. Cordes on galaxy evolution in the early universe, using data from the Cornell-led Fred Young Submillimeter Telescope. Regardless of their endeavors, Cornell students know that their impact on humanity depends on their civic engagement and social awareness. With Cornell's AIPP, I'll attend seminars to understand the social considerations and policy at the heart of all technological innovation on campus. While taking Ethics and Policy in Data Science, I'll gain insights into the ethical implications of my work in Al, from consumer privacy concerns to implicit biases in decision-making. Heck, I can even combine my love for both astronomy and literature-the Black Holes: Race & the Cosmos class will provide an intriguing exploration of astronomy concepts through the lens of Black Studies literature. Even within the bounds of Ithaca, I can easily impact those around me. In high school, while helping teach a fourth grade STEM class, I was constantly inspired by my students' enthusiasm for learning. At Cornell, I would join STEP-UP to help facilitate programs at local schools to encourage more underrepresented students to fearlessly leap into STEM. If accepted to the Milstein Program, I look forward to working collaboratively with my cohort as we embrace interdisciplinary learning approaches in the tech industry. While taking a summer course in tech ethics in 2018, I visited the cutting-edge Cornell Tech campus and spoke with [Name Redacted], who provided advice that later influenced me to independently create an iOS app. Whether based in Ithaca or on Roosevelt Island, the unique guidance provided by the Milstein Program would enable me to innovate more impactful, socially- conscious technology. Simply put, at Cornell, there are limitless ways I could grow while giving back.",

      "essay": "“Ka-ching!” Success! This was not a real cash register but the sound of a notification from the Etsy app on my phone. I eagerly read the screen. “One new order.” Someone bought something I created! A childish glee coursed through me as I opened the Etsy app.\n\nThis adventure began two years ago when I clicked the “Publish” button on my new Etsy shop. (Etsy.com, a virtual marketplace, accommodates everyone from budding entrepreneurs to experienced sellers.) Soon came the first order, and I was hooked. At first, my shop in the cloud sold art prints built of simply two components: ink and cardstock. But with increasing confidence, I experimented with new styles, concepts, and materials. My shop expanded to offer a selection of products including wedding invitations, iPhone cases, and business-logo designs.\n\nTo create a market for my products and services, I opened two Instagram accounts. I contacted Instagram users with anywhere from 30,000 to 100,000 followers to sponsor my shop, which meant they would post photos of my art and share their followers with me in return for free products. Many more “Ka-chings!” rang out as my little business burgeoned into an international enterprise with customers in Australia, Canada, and England. I grew with it. I began to take risks. I acted on other ideas, including building a professional photography business.\n\nMy shop, created as a hobby, soon opened up new opportunities. I’ve collaborated with several entrepreneurs, including the winner of the international Starbucks White Cup Contest. My art has been published in Ama-gi Magazine and I’ve licensed my designs to businesses nationwide: a clothing store, a phone case shop, and a paper goods company. Most recently, Rocksbox.com, a jewelry company featured on Forbes.com, asked me to sponsor their company because they want access to my customer br. I will showcase their products on my Instagram accounts.\n\nAlthough I enjoy designing, I relish the “Ka-ching!” and what it means to me. It represents non-monetary rewards: confidence, because I made important business decisions; productivity, because I worked within a tight schedule to deliver quality products; and excitement, because my Etsy success has inspired me to chase other opportunities. I’ve also learned some real-life skills: communicating effectively with customers, enjoying focused work, researching marketing techniques, brainstorming product ideas, organizing my time, and taking risks with my own money. Most significantly, I experienced how a few bold ideas and diligence can translate into confidence and the joy of achievement.\n\nIn the beginning, my business wasn’t very lucrative. I earned far less per hour than the minimum wage. But the “Ka-ching!” is not about money, it’s about total strangers around the world giving me a vote of confidence for my hard work with every dollar they spend.\n\nThey say that there is a profound link between sense and memory. Everyone experiences this with a familiar smell or sound because the same section of the brain that holds memories also has sensory processing ability. For me, that cash register sound always recalls the thrilling sense of achievement, assurance, and connection with other people. That is the power of “Ka-ching!”\n\n",

      "essay": "I don’t know what hit me first, the sight or the smell of the dead pig. It must have been dead for a few hours as the smell had begun to condense around the table. I could still see the purplish bruise left from where my uncle clubbed it, and the sanguine laceration underneath his leg leading to his heart, still dribbling blood. The pig’s expression was a mixture of confusion and pain, unaware what was happening until it was too late. I didn’t realize, however, that I was blocking my uncle from passing until he shoved me aside and motioned me towards the table. With each step I took, the air thickened with a mix of rotting death and whiskey that only a dead pig and my uncle’s presence could provide. My uncle turned to me brandishing the rustiest knife I’ve ever seen from a sheath in his belt, handed it to me, looked me in the eye, and said, “I need you to cut up dinner for us.”\n\nTwo years ago was my first time visiting the sitio, a recreational farm, built by my uncle since I last visited Brazil. Upon arrival, my uncle stated his intention to “beat the city life out of me” through work in his usual jovial manner. He proceeded to sit back and open up a bottle of whiskey while I fed the donkeys and created a makeshift irrigation system out of a punctured hose I interspersed through his crops. Despite attacking all the previous chores with aplomb, I was dumbstruck while alone with the pig. I couldn’t take another step closer for fear of succumbing to the noxious odor worsening by the second, nor could I raise the shaking knife in my hand. Minutes passed, and my mind raced. “This knife is so rusty, is this even sanitary? What if it poisons the pork and we eat it and die? Avunculicide, matricide, and suicide via a single pig- that’s got to be a record. What if I mess up? I think I’m going to puke.” Before I could follow up on that, my uncle walked back inside, noticed I was failing at my task, and snatched the knife away from me while I retreated into the kitchen. Eventually, he emerged uncharacteristically silent and blood-soaked, then he sat down next to me and poured himself another drink, clearly disappointed in me. After a few minutes of silence, he looked up and with whiskey on his breath said, “You can’t be afraid of messing up. Some things need to be done, and you’ll have to step up.” And with that he walked away.\n\nMy first response was to never eat pork again, a short-lived promise as dinner that night was pork and the carnivore inside me shall not be denied. More importantly, however, I realized that the idea of failing and disappointing someone terrifies me. Thus, I had limited myself by only partaking in activities that I was certain to succeed in, such as learning music, and participating in the Library Council. These activities are very important to me, but they only require you to put in effort to succeed. My uncle, however, tried to explain that I should be willing to take risks and have more faith in myself. Recently, I’ve taken my uncle’s words to heart and have opened myself to growth, and while I haven’t escaped my fears, I’ve used them as motivation to succeed in new endeavors, such as founding the Current Events Club, and joining Mock Trial and Improv Club. These activities all require you to risk failure in order to succeed, whether through an objection, a skit, or creating and promoting a new club. This incident has led me to excel in these activities, and has made me willing to take necessary risks in order to succeed throughout my college career and the rest of my life.",

      "essay": "Every time I swung my leg back, I froze.\n\nIt didn’t matter how many times I’d tried, or how perfectly I was postured. The moment I was ready to jump, flying across the ice with my arms poised to snap in, my heart would catch and I’d fall out of position, gliding uselessly around the corner to make another futile attempt. It was in this way that I muddled my way through practice – arranging myself into an array of takeoff positions before falling out of form, like I really hadn’t planned to do a thing.\n\nI often left the ice near tears, but I would tell myself that I was at the very least persevering. I had this naïve idea – remnant of the old elementary school mantra – that the only thing worse than failing is giving up. I had too much pride, and it clouded my judgment, deluding me into settling for the status quo. I kept skating not because I loved it too much to give up, but because I didn’t want to admit defeat.\n\nIn June of my freshman year, I decided that it had to end. I would perform one final time at the end of the summer, and would never look back thereafter. That day, in late August, I pulled on my tights and knotted my hair with a bittersweet feeling of finality. I was glad to finally let go of that stubbornness, to free up room in my life to explore something new. But I also hated to think that, after all my years of trying, I was surrendering with little to show. So I waited to be announced that afternoon, leaning against the glass panels that encircled the ice, with neither grief nor joy – just a vague sense of relief.\n\nAcknowledging the audience and judges for the last time, I took my starting position with unusual calm. When the music began to play, something stirred in me, a spirit that had grown foreign years ago. I forgot the audience, my coach, even my mother, who was watching from the stands. I forgot the struggles, mental and physical, that had plagued me on ice for years. The self-defeating pressure I’d imposed on myself lifted, and I was empowered to release all my energy on that ice. Every muscle in my body seemed simultaneously lighter, stronger, nimbler. Although I’d practiced with the music hundreds of times, in that moment each note made me want to jump higher, spin faster, and skate. For the first time, I wasn’t sequentially completing the elements – I was genuinely performing. And I remember thinking, as I moved into jump takeoff, launched into the air, and landed with a satisfying grind of blade to ice: so this is what passion feels like.\n\nI finally recognized, while basking in the rush of excitement, that what I had been missing all along was that emotional spark. I had a strong work ethic, but without the drive of a passion, I was toiling away only to maintain mediocrity. I had become so fixated on progressing as an athlete that my purpose as a figure skater, my love for the beauty of the sport, had quietly slipped away without my noticing. It was tragic that I could not retrieve it but for a fleeting moment, when the journey was at its end and I had nothing to lose. But since that day two years ago, I’ve fallen in love with new pursuits: debate, social advocacy, political activism. Inevitably, I every once in a while begin sliding back into disillusionment. When that happens, I take a step back and remind myself: it’s not about being impressive, and it’s not about protecting yourself from failure. It’s about doing meaningful work, remembering your purpose, and bringing about change using the power that can only come from having a dream.\nUnlock your academic potential with our fast essay writing service!

      "essay": "Beauty is meant to be a right-angled thing, my parents taught me. The object must be symmetrical, clearly defined, approved by the right critics, and represented in fine art. We cannot make beauty; we can only look at it, they said. But even though nodding knowingly at Mozart’s melodies or Michelangelo’s murals was apparently the closest we could get to the stars, I didn’t want to look at their shine; I wanted to create it.\n\nBut naturally, creating beauty means creating it by the rules. I tried to combine Milton’s cosmic themes, Blake’s aphoristic style and Pope’s eloquence in my writing, but in doing so I didn’t make a work worthy of worship – I ended up with a lump of pompous sentiments that no teenager could ever think up. How could I ever create something praiseworthy?\nI found my answer in “Ulysses”. Laboring through James Joyce’s labyrinthine sentences, I realized that nestled in the seemingly irrelevant (and slightly annoying) observations that popped up everywhere – like Stephen Dedalus’ musings on the milk woman as he mourns his dead mother – was a different beauty: the beauty of the real and the unexpected. And Joyce hadn’t even looked up to the heavens to write this; he had just looked around.\n\nIn trying to versify like masters of old, I had leapt too high. What profundities about humanity and heaven could a seventeen-year-old pen?  I had always looked to the stars for inspiration when I tried to enliven my page with similes that likened eyebrows to comets and freckles to constellations; never had I thought that I would find the mundane worth immortalizing in metaphor as Joyce did: a man spits out a “coughball of laughter”; a boy moves his legs “frogwise”. So like a frog – in fits and starts– my conception of beauty leaped somewhere else.\nMad as it might have made me, “Ulysses” showed me that beauty is not confined to canvas or immured in marble – that someone like me could actually create something worthy of the label beautiful. With his daringness in mind, I now start each day by firing off on a piece of stream of consciousness and picking through it for anything worth reworking. I don’t wreathe my stories with archaic literary devices anymore; instead, I mine reality for the moments that I can draw meaning from. Only after I have hammered out and polished the mess will I allow myself – just maybe – to put in a mythical allusion.\n\nNot for me the cold curves of Greek statuary or brushstrokes of Renaissance portraiture: I look for the numinous in the normal; the magical in the mundane – the puff of steam from a rice cooker; the happy pop of firecrackers on Chinese New Year; the calligraphy of sunlight on the harbor surface – because these are now what beauty is to me.\n\n",

      "essay": "I remember my first show, which I still consider the greatest day of my life:  The torn red carpet underneath my kit was accented by the unmistakable aroma and sight of broken drum sticks littered around the riser.  My sharpie-scribbled setlist was carefully blue taped next to my stool as the repeatedly flashing disco-esque lights and fog machine busied the stage.  I was 13 years old and had been writing music with a group of slightly older guys for the past few months.  This small restaurant’s time-worn stage was my canvas for the next 45 minutes, as I unconsciously fused into the drummer I now am for the first time.  I let reason exit as I found myself using walls as drums and twirled my sticks in second nature as I stood up to play during solos.   I didn’t mind that there were only 12 people in the restaurant.  I didn’t mind that some of them were simply enjoying their greasy chicken appetizers instead of watching the show.  I was solely focused on enjoying myself and playing the best music that I possibly could.  This was an independent world and I loved it.\n\nI play the drums; I’ve played them for as long as I can remember, from weekly lessons starting in 2nd grade, to county honor bands, and currently bars and night clubs.  Music has always been an intrinsic part of my daily schedule, and I am forever grateful.  Music, especially composition, has continually spurred my intellectual capacity.  For example, I tap my feet whenever seated.  It’s an involuntary reaction to the countless rhythms and musical styles forever floating about my mind.  Unconsciously tapping out bossa nova allows me not only to focus and structure my thoughts and ideas, but to constantly stay alert.  This forever pulsating beat within me pushes me to achieve efficiency in my life.  Even in the mundane activity of driving to school, the tapping of samba on my black leather steering wheel gives me a sense of constantly moving and growing, not only as a musician, but as a person.  \n\nIt’s the “inexhaustible variety of life”, as F. Scott Fitzgerald once put it, that inspires me to strive for greatness.  It’s the idea that you can blend distinct styles of music.  The idea that jazz can be fused into modern rock songs while using a pair of timpani mallets and some wire brushes to create something undeniably new.  Some of my favorite moments are spent in my brment just improvising with the phrasing and fusing of cultural beats and rhythms.  This cross-culturalization has permeated into my life in other ways, as I find myself the product of both Mexican and American backgrounds.  Fusions of ideas and traditions inspire me to keep exploring and experiencing more of life.\n\nMy life can be summarized as the constant intertwining of distinct cultures.  I spend my Saturdays in dive bars and Hollywood clubs, continuing to express my passion for creating and performing, while devoting the rest of my energies to sport and academics.  Experiencing and interacting with others of varying backgrounds is my true inspiration and I hope to one day be a part of such a hotbed of diversity.\n\nAlthough my ultimate goal is to one day work in the foreign service and to become an impetus for change in the political arena, I will still continue to be the drummer I’ve always been.  I wish to form a band in my college years and continue to play shows while enjoying my time in the classroom.  Like different musical inspirations, my identities all forge together to reveal who I truly am, not just a drummer, not just an athlete, but someone who intends to grow in his respective identities and to sculpt even more facets of being.\n\n",

      "essay": "My exploits in history began in pursuit of the past.\n\nThe soles of my feet screamed for mercy as I dragged myself through the pages of the internment camps of World War II;\n\nOh, the cruelty of men! Legacy, legacy, what is a legacy?\n\ngrasping helplessly in the dusty air of the cruel road, finding nothing but silent text trapped in black and white;\n\nperhaps some choose to remain frozen in time, perhaps it is better to remain oblivious, perhaps it is easier to become a part of history rather than create it\n\nmind racing with the anger of those cast aside, stripped of their humanity, line by line.\n\nI cannot allow myself to settle for easy.\n\nI am in awe of the sublime and mediocre of centuries preserved within the books on my shelf.\n\nSurely I must have a part in this narrative!\n\nBut history has taught me that the greatest failure is to be satisfied with the world when it is undeserving of such patronage.\n\nWhat is my part, if not to stand when others sit in fear? What is my part, if not to use my voice to amplify those of the oppressed? What is my part, if not to feel hurt in solidarity?\n\nWhere is the accountability? The echoes of history whispered as pen touched paper where quill blotted parchment, signing the Hepburn Act into legislation a hundred years earlier. I felt Teddy Roosevelt’s determination to bring trusts to justice, a reminder that there is good in the world, for which it is worth fighting. Undaunted by research turning up abuses of power rivaling those of the Gilded Age, I held the law and corporations liable for failing users’ privacy with my headline featured on the Best of SNO website: “Google’s Project Nightingale Infringes on Privacy.”\n\nWhere is the change? The voices of history wept as I spoke to the crowd at the 2018 March for Our Lives campus walkout, led by my social justice club Intersections. I was a daughter of liberty, the worn planks of the Eleanor creaking beneath my feet as I dumped empty promises into the harbor, screaming that we had had enough! enough! enough!\n\nWhere is the representation? Lost identities of history emerged as I redefined American literature. When I discovered The Joy Luck Club, my conception of the written word was transformed irrevocably. In 288 pages, Amy Tan told me who I was in a way that “American” literature never had. Am I American? In her novel there was no projection of a stereotype—the characters were the winds of the East and West borne into one. In the eye of the storm there is quiet. I reveled in joy and collapsed in grief as I saw myself in June, Rose, Waverly, and Lena, my identity hovering within my grasp. At school, I went door-to-door in the English wing, asking for op-ed interviews with students and teachers about the profound effect literature has on our identities. The common ground we found in our regard for literature sparked several friendships, and a few teachers committed to integrate novels by writers of color into their curricula. I laughed and cried as I helped my community take crucial first steps towards the incorporation of diversity as a standard in education.\n\nUsing my voice to challenge what others have settled for, I learned to let go of the confines of the past, embracing what is to come. I will not be complacent. I am real and real and real and cannot stop; I am free of stereotypes, expectations, boundaries. I have become the diligent disciple of men and women whose legacies are my history. Inspired by the complexities of their stories, I cannot help but ask of my world these imperative questions. And I will continue to seek answers, defining my part in this narrative.\n\nI persist in pursuit of the future. ",

      "essay": "It was late at night, and I had already powered off my laptop when my phone buzzed:\n\n“I think we’ve made a big mistake. We have to restart the project.”\n\nStaring at the message, I was in disbelief. After working for weeks, how could he expect us to scrap everything, and still meet the fast-approaching deadline? I immediately dismissed his absurd suggestion, and my patience wore thin as he pushed back with frustratingly convincing arguments. Ultimately perceiving his suggestion as an attempt to usurp my authority, I declared that the leader decides for the team, I was the leader, and my answer was a definitive no.\n\nI have always been comfortable in leadership roles, so when my fellow students and I were divided into project teams at Cornell Summer College this year, I immediately volunteered to be our group leader. Tasked with comparing the stocks of two direct competitors and selecting the more favorable option, I decided to choose Dunkin’ Donuts over Starbucks, delegated the workload, and scheduled our research in advance. Our report was well-written, supported by sound analysis, and completed well before the deadline. Then, two days before our presentation, Thor, one of my teammates, dropped his bombshell proposal: to start the project over from scratch and pick Starbucks stock instead.\n\nUnable to sleep that night, I questioned why my leadership suddenly felt so shaky. I reassured myself that my decision to reject Thor’s motion was in the team’s best interest. Yet, I had doubts. Replaying our exchange in my mind, I began to wonder why I had been so quick to veto his suggestion. It was raised with good intentions and, despite the infeasibility of completely restarting our research last minute, could be considered in perhaps reforming aspects of our current research.\n\nHaving always thought of a leader as the gatekeeper of ideas, judging their merit and making the final call, I had for weeks treated my teammates as second fiddles. By allowing them only enough freedom to complete delegated tasks but never to influence the overall direction of the project, the work we produced “as a team” consequently reflected what I would have produced on my own. It occurred to me that my previous understanding of leadership was missing a dimension. Instead of controlling the flow of ideas with an iron grip, it dawned on me that real leaders should consider each unique perspective with an open mind so that the best insights can be capitalized upon. I realized that my teammates likely had many more valid ideas than I gave them credit for, and I became determined to change my approach.\n\nLoosening my control, I called a team meeting to broach an open-ended conversation about the direction of our project. Pleasantly surprised to be included in this way, my two other teammates expressed desires to keep our presentation as it was. To their dismay, though, Thor remained adamant about the relative strength of Starbucks stock. I encouraged my other teammates to consider his arguments with an open mind. Together, we arrived at a compromise: to short our original Dunkin’ Donuts stock and invest long-term in Starbucks, so that we could use our previous analysis while also incorporating Thor’s ideas. This time, I watched my teammates excitedly reformulate the analysis, providing feedback when requested but no longer attempting to control the process.\n\nBy empowering my teammates to bring their best ideas forward and directly influence the direction of our project, I led them to produce a presentation that exceeded the project requirements by exploring short-sell strategies. We received a 98% score for the overall project, which, although satisfying, was far overshadowed by my new, nuanced understanding of leadership. Although leaders must take charge, they must also know when to step back to allow the emergence of fresh insights from their team.\n\nNothing like a project on coffee to give me that kind of wakeup call.\n\n",

      "essay": "I sat frozen on the stage. I was at my first major dance performance, at the 2010 Commonwealth Games Opening Ceremony, and my cue had come. Ten seconds passed, and I was still frozen. Twenty seconds. Thirty seconds. No movement.\n\nThis was my performance: keeping my body still as a statue. My role was to use subtle facial expressions to depict the guru-shishya (teacher-student) relationship sitting under the Tree of Knowledge.The piece depicted how teachers impart wisdom from the tree of knowledge to their students.\n\nWith a large bright-red tilak mark on her forehead, eyes outlined with black kohl and a body swathed in Sambhalpuri sarees, my guru brought a sense of other-worldliness to our institute (Shri Kamakhya Kalapeeth) for Indian Classical Dance Odissi. Her love of tradition was reflected in her teachings. For instance, she opposed the use of props and set decorations: if we dancers were truly embodying the story, our expressions and mudras would be enough. Our performances were not for mere entertainment; we served as cultural ambassadors. She never verbally complimented anyone. Approval was tacit, usually indicated by selection for some performance. Some students did not get a chance to perform for years.\n\nSurprisingly, I got my chance rather early. At the age of ten, I was one of the youngest to receive ghungaroos, which are anklets with metal bells that serve as vessels through which the guru confers a blessing onto the student. This was a pivotal point in my journey.\n\nAfter this, I started performing all over India. Whenever I stepped on stage, I got lost in the performance, and for those few moments nothing else mattered. At times, I was called on stage to play several characters in the same dance just through a change of expressions. I started to truly feel the power of pure Odissi to inhabit other characters, and other worlds.\n\nSo much of my energy went into dancing, I found myself involuntarily living dance – painting canvases with dance themes, practicing dance moves while taking phone calls, and even revising steps in my mind during long swim workouts. This was when I realised that Odissi was more than a hobby; it was my passion.\n\nOn my 15th birthday I received a gift I will cherish for life–my teacher booked an auditorium for my Rangapravesh: a debut solo-dance recital. The coming months were intense. I came home exhausted from rehearsals, but my tired feet ached to dance again.\n\nAs the practices got longer, my bond with my guru grew stronger. Then came the penultimate day of practice for my Rangapravesh. After completing one of my longest and toughest compositions, “Dashavatar”, I was going to change my sweat-soaked clothes when my teacher called me next to her. This was odd; usually I would simply be dismissed. With arms wide open she said, “I see my reflection in you.” Trembling, I went closer and hugged her. After nine years of training I had finally received my first compliment.\n\nEver since, I have felt inspired to carry forward the Odissi tradition. In order to preserve my guru’s legacy, I want to immortalize her dance style by using motion capture suits to transfer her movements onto robots. This way, people all over the world can experience the aura and magic of Odissi. Dance has no boundaries, and progressivism is how I perceive Odissi can be preserved. As I embark on university study abroad, I want to be in an environment that is not only engulfed with reverence for knowledge and tradition, but also where I can challenge ideas and craft my own style of teaching.\n\nDuring my dance journey I have learned that education does not emanate passively from a tree of knowledge, but takes hard work, self-motivation, dedicated teachers, and supportive resources. And sometimes, when you are training for a dynamic future, you need to start by sitting still.\n\n",

Sophia is not your average girl. In fact, she’s not a girl at all. Created in an artificial intelligence lab in Hong Kong, Sophia is the most famous android in the world. \n\n \n\nWhen I first read about Sophia the Robot and its apparent ability to feel emotions, I was intrigued yet perplexed. For years, A.I. has revolutionized technology, enabling tasks to be performed rapidly and skillfully. But the single characteristic I long believed separated humans and A.I. was humans’ ability to express emotions. Today, with emotional A.I. undergoing expeditious development, I find myself wondering what actually makes us human. Can only humans have a mind with consciousness and thought? Will machines be able to imitate the human mind or can they perceive emotions only through algorithms? How do humans learn to feel emotions? What is the mind? \n\n \n\nAs a philosophy enthusiast, I am fascinated by the potential for A.I. to recreate the human mind. From Descartes postulating that the mind is identified by a self-awareness to early monists arguing that the mind is a purely physical construct, philosophical theories seek to understand the mysterious minds of humans that science cannot fully explain. In college, I hope to study the Philosophy of Mind and Artificial Intelligence in order to better understand our minds and the technology that is increasingly resembling them. ",

After two weeks with quirky essay prompts, vocab games, improvised debates and a lesson titled ”How to Fail”, students’ creativity flowed and the stigma of making mistakes seemed forgotten.\n\n \n\nBut there’s a limit to the impact of two high-school students; education systems around the world need nation-wide policies that do not just provide the resources but also ensure they are used effectively. Putting students in school might equip us with the skills necessary in the “world of tomorrow”, but education at its best – the type I hope to experience at Yale – enables us to have a say in what that world will look like.

Making my way in and out of class, I can see myself fascinated by the world there. I hope to further explore nano-technology and how it can more specifically apply to the smart grids of the future, improving the efficiency of current technology. I would cross my classes in ECE in Dr. Albertson's concentration called, \"Engineering Smart Cities,\" to understand exactly how power grids need to be improved for the future of cities. Collaborating with Dr. David Bindel, I'd like to explore how coding contributed to making smart grids smart by exploring the algorithms diagnosing its line failures. The Systems Engineering program is interdisciplinary in nature, with Professors like Lang Tong forming a bridge between computer and electrical engineering by exploring how cloud computing can reduce costs in grid optimization. Working with Cornell's professionals in the CESI, the hub for energy-related research at the university, Cornell proves the most promising in intersecting my dreams of pursuing engineering and contributing to the future of sustainable urban living.",

      "essay": "My heel strikes the pavement, calf muscles flexed to brace for the mechanical load of the impact. As my weight shifts forward, I imagine horizontal velocity vectors extending directly ahead. The angle created by my knee increases as I hit the propulsion phase of my stride, and with a final drive of force, I push off from my forefoot.\n\n \n\nI discovered my fascination with sports biomechanics in the USC Biomechanics Research Lab. In my research project, I apply scientific principles to running to prevent stress-induced injuries in athletes. By analyzing video frames of PAC-12 athletes in motion and linking them to force plate data, I seek to understand the forces behind running. Comparing these conclusions to the data of athletes after a stress fracture, I can deduce the tangible differences that increase susceptibility to injury. To accomplish this goal, I have learned to use Python and MATLAB to sync the video and force plate data to create graphs for analysis. I have also used sports analysis programs to identify the locations of joints in individual frames and create videos overlaid by force vectors. Through this work, I hope to use my passion for sports biomechanics to improve the health of athletes.\n\n \n\nMy interest in sports biomechanics also extends outside of the lab, where I see my knowledge in motion. Neighborhood runs are scientific feats where I analyze my movements with principles of physics. With every step, I seek to improve my performance, putting sports biomechanics into action as an athlete.",

      "essay": "I thought there was something wrong with me when I realized that I was a terrible swimmer. Swimming never came naturally to me and I considered it to be my biggest adversary at the time. I began to take swim lessons at the age of twelve and I dreaded every moment. However, my parents continually pushed me in hopes that I should learn this lifelong skill, especially since they never had this opportunity growing up. Each lesson ended just as the previous: in failure. I believed that my effort was useless when it came to swimming and felt defeated after each swim lesson.\n\nAll was not futile, for I did make progress session after session. I went from not being able to even step into the water to mustering up enough courage to calmly float on my back. But my progress was relatively stagnant, for I still feared the water and did not dare to fully submerge myself. My parents were still unceasing in their efforts. Although they were unable to directly coach me in swimming, they managed to coax our town’s swim team coach to take me on the team. It was clearly evident to the team coaches that I was not proper material for the team, but my parents’ relentless efforts had worked. Before I knew it, I was “part” of the swim team, on condition that I would improve my swimming skills within two weeks.\n\nAnd within two weeks, through constant exposure to the water, I managed to swim; slowly, but nonetheless, I was swimming. I actually enjoyed swimming for quite some time, until my first competition, in which I was put to shame by the more advanced swimmers. I would finish races forty seconds after my competitors had all finished. I didn’t mind coming in last, but I did mind the cheering I received. I perceived it as an expression of the audience’s pity for my performance. I eventually swam averagely compared to rest of my team, but I never felt as though I had accomplished anything of significance.\n\nIn life, we tend to accentuate our failures and ignore the tiny successes that we have had along the way. For a long period of time, I completely forgot how far I had come as a swimmer, and was quick to dub my entire competitive swimming experience as a “failure”. Whenever I won any awards, I would perceive them as hidden behind the shadow of my initial failures. However, now I can see the major impact swimming has had on my life. Learning to swim was my first true challenge, and the road I took to overcoming it was one filled with numerous struggles. Now that I look back at it, I realize every small success that I have had along the way. Swimming truly defined me as an individual. As a child, I would remember thinking that if I could possibly overcome my fear of swimming, I could overcome anything. Now I know I can.",

I felt as if the words came naturally, whether it was differentiating between the verbs saber and conocer, or how different letter combinations produce different sounds, like how two l's make a y sound. The more I learned Spanish, the more I realized why it was fun: It was much like Arabic, taking what I knew and putting a new spin on it. Like how camisa means shirt but is pronounced differently in both languages. Soon, I was listening to some of my favorite Spanish songs, “Tusa” and “Taki Taki,” without needing a translation.\n\nIn addition to Spanish and Arabic, I also speak Turkish, the language of my father’s family, and English, which I learned in school. It wasn’t enough to just learn. My love of linguistics prompted me to inspire that same love in others, so I volunteered to teach English to Arabic-speaking elementary students.

      "essay": "Superhero cinema is an oligopoly consisting of two prominent, towering brands: Marvel and DC. I’m a religious supporter of Marvel, but last year, I discovered my friend, Tom, was a DC fan. After a 20-minute vociferous quarrel about which was better, we decided to allocate one day to assemble coherent arguments and have a professional debate.\n\n \n\nOne week later, we both brought pages of notes, evidence cards, and I had my Iron-Man bobblehead for moral support. Our moderator – a Disney fan – sat in the middle with a stopwatch – open-policy style. I began the debate by discussing how Marvel accentuated the humanity of the storyline – such as Tony Stark’s transformation from an egotistical billionaire to a compassionate father – which drew in a broader audience because more people resonated with certain aspects of the characters. Tom rebutted this by capitalizing on how Deadpool was a duplicate of Deathstroke, Vision copied Red Tornado, and DC sold more comics than Marvel. \n\n \n\n40 minutes later, we reached an impasse. We were out of cards, and we both made excellent points, so our moderator failed to declare a winner. Difficult conversations aren’t necessarily always the ones that make political headlines. Instead, a difficult discussion involves any topic with which we share an emotional connection. Over the years, I became so emotionally invested in Marvel that my mind erected an impenetrable shield, blocking out all other possibilities. Even today, we haven’t decided which franchise was better, but I realized that I was undermining DC for no reason apart from ignorance. \n\n \n\nThe inevitability of diversity suggests that it is our responsibility to understand the other person and what they believe. We may not always experience a change in opinions, but we can grant ourselves the opportunity to expand our global perspective. At Princeton, I will continue this adventure to increase my awareness as a superhero aficionado, activist, and student by engaging in conversations that require me to think beyond what I believe and viewing the world from others’ perspectives. \n\n \n\nAnd yes, Tom is still my friend.

Of course, the absence of alpine features is self-evident for a tropical island, yet these ostensibly challenging aspects of Cayman’s climate and terrain did not hinder the establishment of the team I now represent: the Cayman Islands Confederation and Association of Snow Sports (CICASS). Unfortunately, I have been the object of frequent derision due to the peculiar nature of my ski team; few ski racing competitors suppress their initial feelings of unease towards a diversified pool of nations participating in our sport, and they often fail to realize that increased international diversity will enhance skiing’s worldwide appeal. Currently, one is considered an outsider, at worst a fraud, if he does not ski for one of the historically famous ski nations. However, this misguided prejudice is flawed, and after college I intend to continue challenging it by competing at the highest level for the Cayman Islands. A person’s athletic worth shouldn’t be decided by trivial elements such as nationality or ethnicity but rather by more pertinent factors, including athletic competence and commitment.\n\nWhen I began competing for the Cayman Islands in 2008, I felt estranged from the skiing community I had previously participated in. To my dismay, I was forced to act independently, and resultantly I transformed into a target for the animosity of all but a few of my closest friends. I existed as a victim of the prevailing ignorance: The belief that a skier native to a tropical, or otherwise unusual, country must be talentless. Moreover, qualification for serious professional competitions is facilitated due to the lack of internal competition within small national teams, which meant jealousy was also evident. I became aware that the only way to validate my involvement with the Cayman team was to improve my technical ability. It was necessary to train assiduously, to learn new concepts fastidiously, and to never capitulate to athletic adversities. Little did my detractors know, I would use my emotional alienation as fuel to motivate my self- improvement.\n\nEventually, my industrious approach to ski-training, both mentally and physically, translated into astonishing improvements. After years of dedicated ski race training in America, Austria, Canada, New Zealand, and Norway, and off-season strength conditioning, I became my nation’s ski team captain and rose to the peaks of multiple world ranking charts for my age. It was not easy to garner the respect of my rivals, but after consistently placing on the podium at regional, national, and international races, they began to hold me in higher esteem. In the eyes of my peers, I had earned the right to the privileges afforded by my national team status.\n\nMarkedly, the moment I am most proud of came at the end of the 2012 ski season; I was ranked number one in the world for my age in the disciplines of Super-G and Downhill. This achievement did not go unnoticed in the international skiing community; one of the heads of the Fédération Internationale de Ski (FIS) expressed her delight about having a small nation atop two of the leader boards. This recognition reinforced my incentive to dispel the prevalent assumption that a respectable ski racer cannot hail from an unrecognized skiing nation, especially one that has a maximum altitude of forty-three meters.\n\nNeither nationality nor race should automatically define a sportsman; an athlete should only ever be judged by his passion for the sport and the results he achieves in it. It is unjust to disparage a fellow competitor because he is from an unexpected country, and it is certainly unfair to assume that he does not compete, train, and work at least equally as hard as any other athlete. By realizing my dream, by summiting the professional alpine skiing world, I hope to prove these petty prejudices preposterous.\n\n",

My little brother, the one who I taught to pee in the toilet, the one who played in the pool with me every day of the summer for 7 years, the one who threw me in the trash can 3 months ago, had finally realized the potential I have seen in him since he was a little kid. And I was thrilled.\n\nHe told me that after attending the Harvard basketball program, he knew that attending college was the perfect opportunity for him to continue playing the sport he loved as well as get a very good education. His end goal (this is where I almost cried) was to become an engineer at Nike. The best part, though, is that he asked me to help him achieve it. \n\nI was astounded that he thought so highly of me that he trusted me to help him. That night, we began discussing various fields of engineering that he could pursue, as well as the internship opportunities that he classified as “so cool.” As soon as school started, I bought him a planner and taught him to keep his activities organized. I go over homework with him and my baby brother almost every night.\n\nI love using my knowledge to contribute to my family with my knowledge. I am so proud of my brother and our progress. I cannot wait to see him grow as he works to achieve his dream.",

Solve our problems with collective work and responsibility.”\n\nThen the students playing African drums and the xylophones on the floor began the harmonious percussion section and we sang again with as much passion as nine-year-olds can muster. This was my world. As a child, my community was centered around my school. At my school we discovered that if you love something enough, and work hard enough for it, you can do great things for both yourself and others around you.\n\nIn the years since I left, I reflected back on the lessons I learned at school. I determined I wanted to focus on the things I love – mathematics, science, and helping others. I also want to harmonize my abilities with those of other people so that we can work together to make the world a better place.

      "essay": "Ten o’clock on Wednesday, April 2016. Ten o’clock and I was sobbing, heaving, and gasping for air. Ten o’clock and I felt like all my hard work, passion, and perseverance had amounted to nothing and I was not enough. It was ten o’clock on a Wednesday, but it all started in August of 2015. I moved cities in August 2015. I knew the adjustment would be hard, but I thought if I immersed myself in challenging activities and classes I loved, I would get through the year just fine.\n\nI was wrong. With each passing month I experienced increased anxiety attacks, lack of satisfaction in any and every activity, and constant degradation of my personal happiness. By April, I was broken. Naked, bent over the toilet, sweating, shaking, choking on the tightening of my own throat, thinking “not enough, not enough, not enough.” \n\nIt was extremely challenging to pick myself up after such a hard fall. When I finally made it out of the bathroom, I crawled to my room and read “Still I Rise” by Maya Angelou. Her struggle encouraged me to rise to this challenge stronger than I had been before. I prioritized my own happiness and fulfillment, taking care of my body and mind.\n\nI finally realized I did not have to do everything on my own, and began collaborating with my peers to finish the year strong and begin initiatives for the next year. I became a stronger, more confident woman than ever before.",

      "essay": "I rounded third base; dust flew in a whirling cloud of dirt behind me. On my wrist I sported a stained pink wristband with the name of my grandmother, who had recently finished her last chemo treatment. I slid into home plate, narrowly escaping the daunting reach of the catcher. As I got up, I looked around at the field of players, all donning a similar wristband with the name of someone close to them that had battled cancer. I turned to the bleachers and smiled as a sea of pink cheered me on. While cancer can be a dismal matter, it was a merging force that brought a community together for that charity game. Seeing what a unifying tragedy cancer can be, I knew I wanted to help.\n\n \n\nAt the Dyson School within the Cornell SC Johnson School of Business I aim to gain a strong foundation in business, with a concentration in marketing, to conduct meaningful research as an undergraduate. Taking part in the CALS Honors Research program, I aspire to research marketing strategies for increasing cancer screening rates. Having numerous family members that have battled with cancer has shown me the burdensome effect it can have not only on the individual, but on the family. Through my project, I hope to minimize those effects, as catching the disease early on is vital to a patient’s recovery. With the unique opportunity provided by the program, I know that I will have that chance.\n\n \n\nAfter graduation, I want to continue with a career in marketing for the betterment of society. For me, the importance of marketing is not about convincing consumers to buy the latest product to boost sales, it is about encouraging consumers to make decisions that will benefit themselves and their community. With a focus in healthcare, I will have the ability to positively influence people’s precautionary screening measures, keeping them safe and healthy. Similarly, I aim to apply the same principle in other fields during my career and my time at Cornell.\n\n \n\nOne of those fields is green energy. Protecting the planet is a sentiment that is also very important to me, and with its beautiful, vast landscape and focus on environmental conservation, Cornell is the perfect place for me to advance that mission. With the state of today’s climate, the need to act swiftly is paramount, and citizen participation is key. As a marketer, I would strive to convince consumers to make the switch to green energy. In the digital age, marketing relies heavily on the internet, and I am excited to take Digital Marketing with Professor Tomaso Bondi to develop my skills in that area.\n\n \n\nWith Cornell already performing groundbreaking research in sustainable energy, I want to get involved with the initiative from a marketing perspective. An opportunity that intrigues me is the student project Cornell Electric Vehicles. Although it is an engineering project team, I would love to get involved as a student from Dyson working on marketing the effectiveness of the vehicles designed by the team. Switching to electric cars is an efficient way to reduce our carbon footprint and sharing the successes achieved by the team would be a great way to showcase the capabilities of electric vehicles.\n\n \n\nAs a student looking to make a positive impact on his global community through research and marketing, I know that Cornell can provide me with the opportunities to achieve my goals. Whether it be persuading an unknowing cancer victim to receive a screening or a consumer looking for a new car to switch to green energy, I will make a change through marketing. By gaining a strong understanding of the foundations of business and marketing, I will strive to ensure that everyone after that charity game will be able to return home and hug their loved one and have a healthy and thriving planet to call home.",

      "essay": "“Arnav, we want you to apply”, I received this email from Penn and DASHED to tell mum. My naïve self had forgotten I had checked the ‘Student-Search-Service’ box, and schools could send system-generated emails predicated on my SAT scores. \n\n \n\nThis pure, childlike delight was out of my sheer obsession with Penn. When my senior at school got in here last year, I pestered him all year long trying to know HOW. Tireless researching, approaching hundreds of alumni on Reddit, watching EVERY millisecond of YouTube advice, and painting a life-size Quaker on my bedroom walls only to miss the ED deadline by falling to pneumonia: Regardless of these setbacks, I sported an impending dream.\n\n \n\nAt Penn, I intend to revitalize this dream through the College of Arts and Sciences. Classes like “Political Journalism at the Crossroads” and “Queer Theory” blend my love for English and politics which I will reflect through writing for Penn’s signature magazine- The Pennsylvania Gazette. At the Penn Institute of Urban Research and CAS, I aim to make the best use of Summer Humanities Internships (SHIP) and Global Research Internship Programs (GRIP) to finance my collaborative research in the Public Affairs domain. I’ll also sign on for the Penn Debate Society (PDS), and collaborate with TEDxPENN to hear budding speakers from different walks of life. As perhaps my country’s most accomplished debater, I vow to make this my personal goal to lead our team to total victory at the World Universities Debating Championship (WUDC) that Penn has dreamed of winning since 1981. To further my progress with the fight against child labor, I shall assist and seek assistance of a like-minded student-body via the Barbara and Edward Netter Center for Community Partnerships.\n\n \n\nFor someone who’s obsessed with rhetoric, I totally understand the definition of an ‘agreement’. In our context, an agreement would be a two-way street where I avail facilities Penn offers while adding to its community, campus, and unwavering prestige. As I pack my bag with all essentials- my brain, my grit, and my quirky self- I complete one half of the agreement. \n\n \n\nDear Penn, I now wait for you to hand me that beautiful letter as we seal our deal.",

      "essay": "Sister Simone Roach, a theorist of nursing ethics, said, “caring is the human mode of being.” I have long been inspired by Sister Roach’s Five C’s of Caring: commitment, conscience, competence, compassion, and confidence. Penn both embraces and fosters these values through a rigorous, interdisciplinary curriculum and unmatched access to service and volunteer opportunities.\n\n \n\nCOMMITMENT. Reading through the activities that Penn Quakers devote their time to (in addition to academics!) felt like drinking from a firehose in the best possible way. As a prospective nursing student with interests outside of my major, I value this level of flexibility. I plan to leverage Penn’s liberal arts curriculum to gain an in-depth understanding of the challenges LGBT people face, especially regarding healthcare access. Through courses like “Interactional Processes with LGBT Individuals” and volunteering at the Mazzoni Center for outreach, I hope to learn how to better support the Penn LGBT community as well as my family and friends, including my cousin, who came out as trans last year.\n\n \n\nCONSCIENCE. As one of the first people in my family to attend a four-year university, I wanted a school that promoted a sense of moral responsibility among its students. At Penn, professors challenge their students to question and recreate their own set of morals by sparking thought- provoking, open-minded discussions. I can imagine myself advocating for universal healthcare in courses such as “Health Care Reform & Future of American Health System” and debating its merits with my peers. Studying in an environment where students confidently voice their opinions – conservative or liberal – will push me to question and strengthen my value system.\n\n \n\nCOMPETENCE. Two aspects that drew my attention to Penn’s BSN program were its high-quality research opportunities and hands-on nursing projects. Through its Office of Nursing Research, Penn connects students to faculty members who share similar research interests. As I volunteered at a nursing home in high school, I hope to work with Dr. Carthon to improve the quality of care for senior citizens. Seniors, especially minorities, face serious barriers to healthcare that I want to resolve. Additionally, Penn’s unique use of simulations to bridge the gap between classroom learning and real-world application impressed me. Using computerized manikins that mimic human responses, classes in Penn’s nursing program allow students to apply their emergency medical skills in a mass casualty simulation and monitor their actions afterward through a video system. Participating in this activity will help me identify my strengths and areas for improvement regarding crisis management and medical care in a controlled yet realistic setting. Research opportunities and simulations will develop my skills even before I interact with patients.\n\n \n\nCOMPASSION. I value giving back through community service, and I have a particular interest in Penn’s Community Champions and Nursing Students For Sexual & Reproductive Health (NSRH). As a four-year volunteer health educator, I hope to continue this work as a Community Champions member. I am excited to collaborate with medical students to teach fourth and fifth graders in the city about cardiology or lead a chair dance class for the elders at the LIFE Center. Furthermore, as a feminist who firmly believes in women’s abortion rights, I’d like to join NSRH in order to advocate for women’s health on campus. At Penn, I can work with like-minded people to make a meaningful difference.\n\n \n\nCONFIDENCE. All of the Quakers that I have met possess one defining trait: confidence. Each student summarized their experiences at Penn as challenging but fulfilling. Although I expect my coursework to push me, from my conversations with current Quakers I know it will help me to be far more effective in my career.\n\n \n\nThe Five C’s of Caring are important heuristics for nursing, but they also provide insight into how I want to approach my time in college. I am eager to engage with these principles both as a nurse and as a Penn Quaker, and I can’t wait to start.",

But I practiced in front of my mirror, my friends, and my faithful stuffed animals.

A few talked about their LGBTQ+ identities; one addressed bisexual erasure, which I could personally relate to. Slowly, I realized that writing didn’t serve just as a cathartic outlet; it could startle others into empathy and create awareness. \n\nAt the slam, I delivered lines like “Your heritage is more than an exotic enigma.” Afterwards, several Chinese-American classmates told me they could relate. I realized that my writing had the power to give these experiences visibility, which in turn might help erase damaging yet common preconceptions about my ethnicity.\n\nAs a Portland Youth Poet Ambassador, I have opportunities to not only promote creative writing, but also advocate for social equality.

      "essay": "Throughout middle school and high school, I continuously took advanced science and technology classes. It wasn’t until four years ago when my eyes caught a glance of a flier posted next to my biology classroom: “Academy of Biotechnology! Meeting in room 307 today for freshmen interested in biotechnology,” that I realized my two favorite classes were intertwined in a field of their own: biotechnology. \n\n \n\nI’ve been in Room 307 every Thursday this year listening to guest speakers talk about various topics from sleep to drug development, exploring new advances in biotech, and planning the annual career fair.\n\n \n\nLast summer, my internship at Holy Cross furthered my interest in biotechnology. When I was introduced to the da Vinci Xi surgical system – a robot that utilizes high-tech guided targeting and auxiliary technology to achieve less blood loss and a faster recovery time for patients, I was amazed at the employment of technology and its power to renovate the medical field. Cornell’s world-leading academics in its College of Arts and Science, particularly the interdisciplinary Biology and Society major, makes it a dream place for me to pursue my passion in both health and biotechnology. I’m specifically interested in the course on Ethical Issues in Health and Medicine, and the seminar course on Controversies in Science, Technology, and Medicine. These capstone courses under top professors will enable me to acquire knowledge about the breadth of biology within the dimensions of modern medical and ethical issues. \n\n \n\nI love that biotechnology encompasses a public health side as well as a microbiology side. Wanting to further explore the molecular side of biotechnology, I sought out the opportunity to work as a research intern at Montgomery College. I have been modeling protein and protein dockings of a cyanobacterium Synechococcus species through computational biology. I’m also drawn to Cornell’s Biological Sciences major with a concentration in Molecular and Cell Biology, where I can further explore my interest in biotechnology. Cornell’s wide range of courses in this major reflects its commitment to supporting its students with novel opportunities. Particularly, I am drawn to the Orientation Lectures in Molecular Biology & Genetics course. I’m eager to learn about the variety of research that Cornell’s experienced faculty is conducting. \n\n \n\nIt would be an honor to learn from and work with Cornell’s researchers at one of the world’s greatest research institutions, through the myriad of opportunities the college provides. I’m especially interested in the research of Dr. Cohen and his team in the creation of micrometer-scale robots for following biochemical signals and encapsulating a soft tissue analog for new future treatments of disease. \n\n \n\nOutside of the classroom, I hope to combine my passions for public health and advocacy by engaging in the American Red Cross student organization, and perhaps the Cornell Sun. I also excitedly anticipate running Club Cross Country through Cornell’s astounding gorges and gardens. I look forward to contributing to the various student organizations at Cornell with my interests and background. \n\n \n\nCornell’s unique freedom of course selection offers an uncommon opportunity for career exploration. I’m confident Cornell’s College of Arts and Science’s opportunities, courses, cutting-edge research and researchers, and community will make it my perfect next Room 307: an opening to practically endless exploration and growth that cannot be found elsewhere.",

      "essay": "Millions of people around the world live with sickle cell disease (SCD), yet millions of people worldwide do not know what sickle cell disease is. The CDC estimates that about 1 in every 13 Black or African American babies is born with the sickle cell trait. My mother was one of those black babies, and so was my father. Like many Americans, they had no idea what sickle cell was and why the fact that they carry the trait for it matters. They found out seven years later when my younger sister was born with sickle cell anemia. \n\nI have spent most of my teenage years watching my sister suffer. According to sicklecell.com, although the treatment for SCD patients has significantly improved in the US, only about 20% of family physicians are comfortable treating these patients even though it is not contagious. I am not sure what their reasons for not being comfortable are, but I do remember how difficult it was to get help for my sister when she needed medical attention. \n\nThe first time she had a crisis – the term used to describe the pain resulting from the sickled red blood cells blocking the path of the small blood vessels that carry blood to your bones – I was paralyzed with fear. My parents had taught me that a crisis can last anywhere from an hour to several days and that if untreated, it could have severe consequences for my sister. They taught me that I needed to call 911, but it took me a few minutes to remember that I needed to do that. \n\nIt took me a few minutes to get to the hospital and much longer for us to get a physician who understood what my parents were trying to explain about my sister’s medical history. It was on that day that I started thinking about sickle cell anemia patients around the world. I have always recognized that living in the US gives me access to a certain amount of privileged, including access to some of the best doctors in the world. It occurred to me that these same doctors did not know how to approach an issue affecting millions of people of color worldwide, and I wondered how many other doctors worldwide didn’t have that same training or knowledge.\n\nMy sister was hospitalized for almost two weeks, and I spent most of that time in her hospital room researching sickle cell. My research helped me understand how to better care for my youngest sibling, and it renewed my interest in medicine. I have always been attracted to the medical field because I enjoy helping others and solving problems. Finding out that not only do we need more doctors equipped to treat sickle cell but that there is also so much research to be done on the subject helped me realize that this was the right career path for me. \n\nI am interested in pursuing my premedical degree at Cornell because it offers unique opportunities to explore and expand on my medical research interests with advanced classes like the Regulation of Cell Proliferation and Senescence. I believe that a strong molecular biology education will give me a solid foundation that’ll prepare me for both my medical school and the research I intend to pursue. Cornell's interdisciplinary and collaborative nature would also allow me to take courses like Behavioral economics and public policy, which will help me develop a global view of community healthcare. \n\nIn other words, Cornell is the ideal place to nurture me into a globally aware physician-scientist who can significantly impact the way sickle cell is treated and maybe even cured.

      "essay": "Three students from my high school attempted suicide during our sophomore year. They were all in AP classes, participating in multiple extracurricular activities, and well on their way to some of the best and most competitive universities in the country. We all thought that they were doing well, but we were all very wrong. Fortunately, two of the students survived and I am glad to say that they got the help that they needed but one of my classmates died. In his suicide note, he talked about feeling an immense amount of pressure and I could feel his sentiments being echoed by many of my other classmates.\n\nIf someone was keeping track of the number of times students cried or broke down in school from freshman to Junior year, they would have noticed that the number was rising exponentially. For context, I went to a boarding school that prides itself on teaching the brightest students and preparing them for the academically rigorous programs of the top colleges in the country. While I loved a lot of things about my high school, I can admit that the environment in which we studied was very pressure-inducing.\n\nI was alarmed at the number of times I heard students say “I’m going to kill myself” on a daily basis, and many of my closest friends confessed that they considered quitting school. If I am being honest, there were a few occasions where I myself thought about quitting, but I was able to rely on my support system and they encouraged me to keep going. Many students did not have one, or they needed a different type of support. In short, my school community was very stressed, and these red flags made me decide that it was time to do something about it.\n\nBecause of my role as coordinator of the student event planning committee, I spent quite a lot of time in the administrative office, and I noticed how busy our school counselor was. She helped a lot of students, but she simply didn’t have the resources to care for over 2000 students by herself. I had researched and found that yoga and art therapy were empirically proven de-stressing methods. So, I approached the school counselor and she helped me create the mental health club.\n\nI collaborated with the counselor and the library to organize several events every month. We had weekly meditation, stretching, and doodle sessions, “safe space” days where students could simply come and openly share their concerns and worries, and we even hosted therapy dogs once every term. We asked students to rate their mood before and after each session, and 92% of the students said that their stress level had decreased significantly.\n\nThat number is what got me interested in psychology. I was amazed to see that an activity like doodling which many consider mundane, can have such an impact on a person’s mental health. I wondered what else affects our psyche, what does so positively, and what does so negatively. The more research I have done on the topic, the more questions I seem to have. So, I am definitely excited to take courses like educational psychology and adolescence and emerging Adulthood at Cornell which are sure to provide more answers.\n\nI am elated to say that the Mental Health Club is now a formal program of our school that offers weekly sessions and makes it a point to raise awareness about wellness and balance. I plan to use the knowledge I will gain at Cornell to create and introduce programs of this nature in other high-stress environments and learn how to ensure that students are learning in the best conditions possible.",

      "essay": "I was thirteen years old when my mother forced me to put my shoes on and follow her to an art gallery. She told me that an art gallery was like a museum, and until that day, the only other time I had been to the museum was when my 5th-grade class had gone on a field trip to the Natural History Museum to see dinosaurs. I honestly had no desire to see more dinosaur bones, and I informed my mother of this. She told me that this was a different type of museum and that she had a feeling I would like this one a lot better. \n\nMothers know best! I know it's not always true, but it definitely was in my mother's case. She had noticed my budding interest in painting and wanted to nurture it. I remember walking into the room and feeling almost overwhelmed by the beauty. I didn't understand what I saw, but I knew it was special. One of the paintings I saw that day was Razorbill by Lynette Yiadom-Boakye, and I immediately loved everything about the piece. \n\nThat evening, I talked a mile a minute about wanting to visit other galleries and museums, about how hard it must be to paint a particular color this way or that way, and about how I wanted to replicate my favorite paintings. I stayed up in my room that night, trying to paint using the same loose gestural brushwork I saw in Yiadom-Boakye's work. I obviously couldn't at first, but I tried again the next day. And the day after that. \n\nI also spent quite a bit of time researching and learning about some of the artists whose work I saw on that day at the gallery. That research led me to other great artists whose work I have come to know and love - From the classics like Van Goh and Basquiat to the contemporary visionaries like Henry Taylor and Joy Labinjo. I learned about the different painting techniques and practiced as often as possible. \n\nUnfortunately, my school did not have many resources for students interested in art, but I didn't let that obstacle stop me. After looking for months, I finally found an art teacher that was a forty-five-minute drive away, and I enrolled in one of her Saturday classes. Those lessons not only helped me improve my skills, but they also helped me feel more confident in my abilities. \n\nThe more I learned about painting as a medium, the more I wanted to experiment with other art forms. This is one of the reasons Cornell's fine arts program is so appealing to me. The fact that the program includes core studio courses in the mediums that I am interested in, like digital media and drawing would allow me to explore all of my interests. It would also give me a chance to discover new ones through the many elective courses available to Cornell students. \n\nMy goal is to one day create art that excites and inspires others the way that Lynette Yiadom-Boakye inspired me.

He didn’t seem to understand why that was a big deal.\n\nLearning and creating have always excited me. So, when I decided that I wanted to pursue a career in engineering, it was important to me that I find a college that would encourage my need to explore and give me a chance to start creating from my undergrad years. Therefore, Cornell’s unique focus on independent investigations and its requirement of a senior thesis is perfect for me. \n\nMy decision to apply to Cornell was solidified when I discovered that the school is an ABET-accredited Chemical and Biomolecular Engineering School. I am especially interested in learning about Environmental Biotechnology, so it is necessary for me to go to a school that will allow me to learn material that is both applicable and relevant to the industry. \n\nTo prepare for the rigorous curriculum, I have enrolled in a differential equation and engineering basics course at the local institute. I am confident that the foundation I will gain from these courses, along with my experiences in robotics and passion for the field, will make me an excellent addition to the Cornell campus community.

      "essay": "Two years ago, my parents took my siblings and me to Timbuktu. It is a relatively small city in Mali that people often use when referring to far away places, but it also happens to be a city that is historically rich, home to three world heritage sites, and my father’s childhood home. We only spent a couple of weeks in Timbuktu, but it was enough time for me to see and learn some pretty amazing things – like how to make the perfect cup of green tea, how shea butter is produced, and how beautiful the Grand Mosque of Djenné is.\n\nWhat impressed me the most about Timbuktu was its architecture. Most of the city’s buildings are constructed using sunbaked mud bricks. A local tour guide explained to us that in addition to being beautiful, these buildings are perfect for the local climate because they do such a great job at insulating against the heat and cold. The guide explained that these houses are actually more durable and a lot more environmentally friendly than the “modern” houses that they build in bigger cities and most of the western world.\n\nHis words stayed with me, so I spent a lot of time researching this architecture and the man knew what he was talking about. Architects and archeologists have found that many mud-brick buildings have survived centuries with little to no maintenance. Many of those buildings are in Mali, Egypt, and Australia. I saw the evidence of that myself in one of the oldest cities in the world and I was impressed.\n\nI started to wonder why this method of building was not being used or at least studied more in the western world if it is that much better for our environment. So, when I got back to the United States, I asked my history teacher about it and they steered me in the right direction by asking me to look into the business of sustainability. I researched on my own and took an introduction to sustainability class from a local community college. Both of those things taught me that in our current economy, sustainable development of any kind can be, and often is, quite costly.\n\nThe reality is that nations will only promote environmentally friendly practices if they can afford it or profit from those practices. For some, protecting the Congo Basin comes second to protecting the livelihoods of the small lumber businesses around the region, while for others it comes second to making billions of dollars by selling electronics every year. On a smaller scale, families and people also have to choose between sustainability and affordability when it comes to electronics, fashion, and more. I think it’s unfair that families and regions and countries often have to choose between one or the other.\n\nI want to join the efforts of the economists and environmental scientists who are working to find ways to make sustainable options more popular, accessible, and affordable. For a long time, I struggled because I was looking for an academic path that would allow me to explore economics and environmental sciences while learning about business management. These are the fields of study that I need to pursue in order to understand the world of sustainable architecture and manufacturing better, and eventually research ways to make those practices more accessible, affordable, and profitable.\n\nDyson’s unique program is uniquely designed to help me achieve this goal. I would be able to major in applied economics and management (AEM), and Environmental engineering through Dyson’s affiliation with CALS, thus balancing my business education with life science education.

      "essay": "In 7th grade, I was assigned a research project. Although I didn’t know it at the time, this project would end up sparking an interest which would guide me throughout the rest of my public school career. The project was simple: using Google and other resources, I had to find a potential career I’d be interested in pursuing later in life. Being a naive 7th grader, I had virtually no idea where to start. I knew I had a strong preference for STEM, but as to which area of STEM to pursue, I was clueless. After looking at a myriad of other careers, I finally came across aerospace engineering. \n\n \n\nAt first, I was intrigued by the name. I remember thinking that it sounded awesome, and I was compelled to learn more. Fast forward a few days and many hours of research, and aerospace engineering stole my heart. When I got to high school, I took all of the classes my school offered that would be beneficial for an aerospace engineer. AP Physics, Multivariable Calculus, PLTW engineering courses, and countless others made the list, and all the while my desire to become an aerospace engineer intensified. I joined numerous STEM clubs to nurture this interest, and in doing so I not only became a better engineer, but also a better person. I also began looking into outstanding aerospace colleges, and Princeton made the very top of my list.\n\n \n\nWhen I look back on it now, I’m not surprised that aerospace engineering is what called to me in that project. In fact, I’ve been fascinated with planes and rockets since a very young age! I would often build models out of LEGOs, and there are numerous times I spent way too many hours playing Kerbal Space Program. When I discovered there was a career dedicated to those parts of my personality, it makes sense that I’d be drawn to it. I find it fascinating that just by using the arsenals of math and science, we can fabricate every tool needed to explore and catalog the cosmos. If that isn’t powerful, I don’t know what is.\n\n \n\nAlthough aerospace engineering has been my main interest throughout high school, I’ve also felt a pull towards mechanical engineering and robotics. Princeton is unique in that it offers a joint major in mechanical AND aerospace engineering, which is something I haven’t seen at any other school. In addition, Princeton’s certificate program in Robotics and Intelligent Systems will allow me to pursue robotics in the context of aerospace engineering. In particular, if I am admitted to Princeton University, I would love to have the opportunity to conduct research in the Intelligent Robot Motion Lab. The IRoM-Lab’s focus on how robots function in complex environments safely and efficiently has me especially excited, and I’ve come up with a few ideas of my own to be pursued. \n\n \n\nEngineering is the driving force behind progress in society, and I am willing to do everything I can to contribute to that progress.",

Through no fault of their own, students are held back from achieving their full potential. To help close this learning gap, my peers and I offered free tutoring during the pandemic. I taught math and reading to elementary and middle school students, concentrating on the African American community. From this experience, I was exposed to the deficiencies of the public school system and the consequent impact on its students. Nevertheless, I genuinely enjoyed my experience instructing those children. Their warm spirit, limitless energy, and ready minds are all characteristics that I wish to emulate. Due to my experience, I never take my education for granted and am forever grateful for the future it has helped me build. I hope I can work on the public education system and make it more accessible and profitable for the children it is supposed to serve and further give back to the community. ",

      "essay": "Since childhood, I have observed the adults of my life giving up their ideals due to financial struggle. My lawyer mother’s dream of justice was disrupted by the corrupt legal system revolving around bribery. My father’s architectural aspiration collapsed after his company’s bankruptcy. They wanted to contribute positively in society: my mother to protect the righteousness and fairness of the laws, and my father to creatively beautify the world surrounding him. Due to the constant pressure of satisfying the basic needs and the appeal of luxuries, they failed. They were not the only ones as illustrated by politicians whose words promise the people security yet their actions submit to corporations’ contributions. Thus, growing up, I chose to pursue money. Though it sounds like a disingenuous excuse for my own greed, I believe that studying finance and economics can exert positive changes on society because these disciplines are interwoven with industries and the well-being of individuals. Interning with a local financial service firm showed me the importance of financial security, which could produce a significant difference in more community involvement, philanthropy, and personal happiness, even among a small community. Whether it is improving financial literacy locally or addressing the wealth gap nationally, an understanding of money and its effects are necessary for meaningful changes to happen. Everyone seeks to solve world hunger, gender inequality, or climate change. Yet to each of these social problems exists an economic perspective that drives its entire operation to which I am committed to target.",

      "essay": "“I will be the gladdest thing under the sun! I will touch a hundred flowers and not pick one.” – Edna St. Vincent Millay, “Afternoon on a Hill” (Renascence and Other Poems, 1917) \n\n \n\nMy teenage rebellion started at age twelve. Though not yet technically a teenager, I dedicated myself to the cause: I wore tee shirts with bands on them that made my parents cringe, shopped exclusively at stores with eyebrow- pierced employees, and met every comforting idea the world offered me with hostility. Darkness was in my soul! Happiness was a construct meant for sheep! Optimism was for fools! My cynicism was a product of a world that gave birth to the War in Afghanistan around the same time it gave birth to me , that shot and killed my peers in school, that irreversibly melted ice caps and polluted oceans and destroyed forests. \n\n \n\nI was angry. I fought with my parents, my peers, and strangers. It was me versus the world. \n\n \n\nHowever, there’s a fundamental flaw in perpetual antagonism: it’s exhausting. My personal relationships suffered as my cynicism turned friends and family into bad guys in my eyes. As I kept up the fight, I found myself always tired, emotionally and physically. The tipping point came one morning standing at the bathroom sink before school. I looked in the mirror and didn’t recognize the tired, sad girl that looked back with pallid skin and purple eye bags. That morning, I found my mother and cried in her arms. I decided that the fight was over. \n\n \n\nI took a break from fighting. I let go of my constant anger about global problems by first focusing on the local ones that I could do something about, and then learning to do things not because they fixed a problem, but for the simple joy of trying. I apologized to friends that I wronged previously, said yes when my mom asked me to go grocery shopping with her, and spent afternoons alone in the park, just reading. I baked brownies in the kitchen because it made me happy. I slept in on weekends when I could, but I also made an effort to get out of bed and move. I made an effort to be nice-optimistic, even-with the people around me, but more importantly, I made an effort to be nice to myself. \n\n \n\nAfter a period of self-care, the fight in me recharged, but this time I didn’t rush to spend it in anger. Now, it’s a tool I use wisely. I’ve channeled it into tangible causes: I don’t want the feeling of loneliness and anger to fester inside of anybody else, so I work with school administration to create community-building events for my senior class. From being the first to implement a class messaging system to starting a collaborative playlist with all 800 of my peers, I’ve turned my energy into positive change in my community. \n\n \n\nI’ve still got a few more years of teenage angst in me, but the meaning of my rebellion has changed. It’s not about responding to a world that’s wronged me with defiance, anger, and cynicism, but about being kind to myself and finding beauty in the world so that I can stay charged and fight for the real things that matter. \n\n \n\nI’ve realized that the world is my afternoon on a hill, full of sunlight and optimism if only I can see them. Now, I am the gladdest thing under the sun! I can be vulnerable and open, and I can show my passion to the world through love. I will touch a hundred flowers, seize a hundred opportunities, and love a hundred things. I will not pick just one. ",

      "essay": "When I began my internship in my state’s Division of Human Rights, some family members scoffed upon hearing the nature of certain cases I dissected. To them, it was a malapportionment of time to heed race-based workplace discrimination when genocides were ongoing. To them, these government institutions reflected the weakness of modern western culture. Despite this deterrence, I stayed confident that preventing severe human rights violations begins with taking more minor instances seriously.       \n\n \n\nExercising my critical thinking while putting justice into action was fulfilling regardless of a complaint’s validity — I dealt with companies firing employees upon discovering their illness diagnoses. I helped interview a woman claiming language harassment as an English speaker in a majority-Hispanic workplace. I accounted for factors such as respondents having attorneys (unlike complainants) when recommending determinations in the face of contradicting claims. I wasn’t discouraged when the same man called the office for the 10th time that day, shouting his demand that we process his case immediately.       \n\n \n\nBureaucracy can cause waste, yet when I compare human rights protections in the Middle East and the United States, I realize that upholding ethics through the law is necessary for many sectors. The same elements that slow the processing of cases safeguard moral consistency, allowing genuine complaints to be separated from frivolous ones. When “insignificant” discrimination slips through the cracks, more severe violations ensue. At Princeton, I’d extend my work in regional human rights to a global scale, building a safer future for vulnerable populations in the Arab world.",

      "essay": "“One of the great challenges of our time is that the disparities we face today have more complex causes and point less straightforwardly to solutions.” \n\n \n\n– Omar Wasow, assistant professor of politics, Princeton University. This quote is taken from Professor Wasow’s January 2014 speech at the Martin Luther King Day celebration at Princeton University. \n\n \n\nThe air is crisp and cool, nipping at my ears as I walk under a curtain of darkness that drapes over the sky, starless. It is a Friday night in downtown Corpus Christi, a rare moment of peace in my home city filled with the laughter of strangers and colorful lights of street vendors. But I cannot focus. \n\n \n\nMy feet stride quickly down the sidewalk, my hand grasps on to the pepper spray my parents gifted me for my sixteenth birthday. My eyes ignore the surrounding city life, focusing instead on a pair of tall figures walking in my direction. I mentally ask myself if they turned with me on the last street corner. I do not remember, so I pick up the pace again. All the while, my mind runs over stories of young women being assaulted, kidnapped, and raped on the street. I remember my mother’s voice reminding me to keep my chin up, back straight, eyes and ears alert. \n\n \n\nAt a young age, I learned that harassment is a part of daily life for women. I fell victim to period-shaming when I was thirteen, received my first catcall when I was fourteen, and was nonconsensually grabbed by a man soliciting on the street when I was fifteen. For women, assault does not just happen to us— its gory details leave an imprint in our lives, infecting the way we perceive the world. And while movements such as the Women’s March and #MeToo have given victims of sexual violence a voice, harassment still manifests itself in the lives of millions of women across the nation. Symbolic gestures are important in spreading awareness but, upon learning that a surprising number of men are oblivious to the frequent harassment that women experience, I now realize that addressing this complex issue requires a deeper level of activism within our local communities. \n\n \n\nFrustrated with incessant cases of harassment against women, I understood at sixteen years old that change necessitates action. During my junior year, I became an intern with a judge whose campaign for office focused on a need for domestic violence reform. This experience enabled me to engage in constructive dialogue with middle and high school students on how to prevent domestic violence. As I listened to young men uneasily admit their ignorance and young women bravely share their experiences in an effort to spread awareness, I learned that breaking down systems of inequity requires changing an entire culture. I once believed that the problem of harassment would dissipate after politicians and celebrities denounce inappropriate behavior to their global audience. But today, I see that effecting large-scale change comes from the “small” lessons we teach at home and in schools. Concerning women’s empowerment, the effects of Hollywood activism do not trickle down enough. Activism must also trickle up and it depends on our willingness to fight complacency. \n\n \n\nFinding the solution to the long-lasting problem of violence against women is a work-in-progress, but it is a process that is persistently moving. In my life, for every uncomfortable conversation that I bridge, I make the world a bit more sensitive to the unspoken struggle that it is to be a woman. I am no longer passively waiting for others to let me live in a world where I can stand alone under the expanse of darkness on a city street, utterly alone and at peace. I, too, deserve the night sky.",

      "essay": "“If any man stopped and asked himself whether he’s ever held a truly personal desire, he’d find the answer. He’d see that all his wishes, his efforts, his dreams, his ambitions are motivated by other men . . . A stamp of approval, not his own. He can find no joy in the struggle and no joy when he has succeeded.”\n\nEssay/Book: The Fountainhead\nAuthor: Ayn Rand\n—\n\nThe US Open.\n\n \n\nMy parents had asked me if I wanted to come along, and I agreed. We got there; we took pictures next to a giant tennis ball, bought some tennis rackets, and finally headed over to our seats. It was absolutely freezing–and as the match continued, the world around me got darker and darker. An open stadium, I could see the stars in the sky just as clearly as I could feel the cold seeping through my coat. Trying to forget about my discomfort, I gazed up at the stars and listened to the vaguely muffled sounds of grunts and balls hitting the court.\n\n \n\nA million things ran through my head.\n\n \n\nThe persistent cold that I was trying to forget. The beauty of the twinkling lights in the sky. The vast emptiness of the world around me.\n\n \n\nAnd, even as I pulled closer to my mom and dad, an abject feeling of loneliness settled over me, my isolation from the excitement of the crowd making itself apparent as I felt none of the frustration, disappointment, or adrenaline-fueled excitement that the crowd and the players were feeling–a million miles away from my surroundings, insignificant in this moment.\n\n \n\nAnd, it dawned on me, I am. I am insignificant–we all are. Even the tennis players whom we so eagerly watch are only really significant for the few hours of their game–and, is that insignificance necessarily a bad thing? Why should I pursue significance–and essentially, recognition–throughout my life? Why do I feel the need to be recognized? Should I not just want to aid in world progress–whether that be dancing to promote emotional expression, or engineering to promote prosperity and scientific advancement?\n\n \n\nI began to understand the futility of ambition revolving solely around world recognition. Why should the entire world know my name? Shouldn’t success be just knowing that I created something, something that helped someone or something somewhere, something that advanced the face of knowledge or innovation, regardless of whether I gained actual ‘credit’ for it?\n\n \n\nHaving changed my definition of success, I no longer search for significance. My absolute insignificance has never been clearer, clearing the way for me to discover myself in my passions, rather than discovering passions in the hope of gaining relevance. My success is no longer defined by the approval or recognition of anyone but myself, making my successes sweeter and my hard work more gratifying.\n\n \n\nThis leaves no bar on my dreams, no curb on my goals. I’m an aspiring engineer because I love how math and physics and purpose click together as you design and invent and innovate, how the electricity of passion sparks through my fingertips as I stay up late working on my model rockets and deriving simple harmonic equations. I’m a dancer because I love how the music and movements feel in my muscles and bones, how fiery adrenaline rushes through my veins when I am in the middle of a performance. I’m a hopeful social entrepreneur because I want to give purpose to my innovations; I’m a singer because I like to feel the vibrations of songs collecting in my throat; I’m a programmer because I like to ‘logic’ my way through problems. None of its for money, or for a prize, or for world recognition–because even that significance doesn’t last long. I’m insignificant, and whether or not I remain so–as long as I fulfill my own purpose and achieve my own goals–it makes no difference to me.",

I was excited to learn that students from the Princeton Rocketry Club had been instrumental in designing tools for the space program. I couldn't believe that undergraduate students were getting to contribute to the exploration of space. \n\nWhile I was excited to hear about this, I was definitely not surprised.

My aim is to improve the functionality of solar-powered airplanes, and I know that no other school can give the tools and facilities to do that. \n\nLastly, I truly appreciate the fact that Andrea Goldsmith, the current dean of the school of engineering and applied sciences, is not only a brilliant mind but a woman who understands what it is like to be a woman in STEM.

It was called \"Guy\" and came with its own story, leveling system, and narrative story.

This mostly due to my excessive amounts of video games I played as a child through middle school (especially 7th grade).

      "essay": "“This book again?” My mother sighed as she cracked open the punctuation picture book I’d picked out for the fifth time. At the age of four, I had little knowledge of punctuation, so the words “exclamation” and “comma” remained elusive; I grew obsessed with puzzling out its meaning. Growing up in the Hewlett-Woodmere Public Library surrounded by the scent of old books, comforting silence, and librarian friends made it easy to forget about the world outside, yet my thirst for answers always pushed me out of literary comfort zones and into the unknown. Even as I moved on from Magic Tree House to Harry Potter, my inquisitive nature and determination to understand the literature around me only evolved. Foreign concepts and obstacles sparked my ambition as I tackled the intimidating Les Misérables sophomore year, Crime and Punishment junior year, and Jane Eyre senior year. I found a relatability in Joy Luck Club characters that I incorporated into my writing and an emotional outlet in the depths of the poetry aisle and writer communities at literary magazines like Polyphony Lit. I can find similar communities at Penn by curating pieces for Penn Review or spending days soaking in knowledge at the Van Pelt Library, poring over Macbeth or the Iliad. Although libraries may provide sanctuaries, they also open infinite worlds and viewpoints. I realized that stories (no matter what form they take) always manage to capture the intrinsic connection between humans that I seek in every interaction I have. \n\n \n\nI’ve learned that life beyond the library teems with complex characters and lessons of its own–especially at Penn, where students are determined to grapple with difficult questions involving cultural differences or the declining value of art in an increasingly STEM-focused world. I am eager to challenge my boundaries as a reader, writer, and human being by applying the relational lessons of a Fiction and Connectivity seminar to real life, reading to younger generations during Children’s Story Hour at Penn Bookstore, and hosting Open Mic Nights with Kelly Writers House. I can see myself initiating change in society by researching the effects of Western society’s harmful misconceptions of Asian and African-American culture in literature with Professor Josephine Park. Penn will not only satisfy some of my curiosities–it will provoke even more daunting and thrilling questions for me to pursue.",

      "essay": "I used to face two paths: one flocked with taxis, people, and the smell of pizza, and the other a wet street laced with cicada symphonies and the aroma of beef noodle soup. It always felt easier to walk the streets of Taiwan (where people speak meekly and tiptoe around confrontation) rather than New York (where people argue, think, and exist fearlessly). PBS created a documentary titled Tug of War: The Story of Taiwan (1998), and I believed that I embodied the little potato island, since balancing between two cultures resulted in a “Tug of War” within me. Although I am proud to be Taiwanese, New York has cultivated an unbridled emotion and passion within me, molding me into a bold author, shameless poet, and strong-willed advocate for Asian-American youth. I am excited by the similar passion and confidence of Penn students, and the vibrant conversations I might have at a Campaign for Community event about racial justice or with Professor David Eng about Asian literature influences upon American society. I can support peers struggling with their own “Tug of Wars” by sharing my story through the Penn Taiwanese Society, and learn their stories as a writer for Robinson Press.",

      "essay": "At 10:30 pm on a hot, summer, Wednesday night, you would expect my friends and me to be having the time of our lives and going out on crazy high school adventures— but instead, we were actually stuck in a chemistry laboratory trying to map out the Lewis structure of sulfuric acid.\n\nOver the summer of my sophomore year, my friends and I enrolled into ‘Introduction to Chemistry’, an evening course at our local community college. As a six-week summer course, I spent two hours in lecture, two hours in the laboratory, and another two hours studying on my own for four days a week for six weeks. It was evident that I struggled with adjusting to the pace of college when I received 19% on a quiz. I felt left behind, exhausted, and overall pathetic. No matter how many hours I spent studying, I couldn’t keep up. But instead of giving up, I picked up certain strategies like reading the material the night before, rewriting my notes, and joining a study group; eventually working my way up to a B.\n\nAt the end of that summer, I learned so much more than just chemistry. On top of having the raw experience of what college is like, my chemistry experience taught me that it is okay to fail. I discovered that failure is an essential part of learning. Coming to this realization inspired me to take more college courses and rigorous courses in high school. I transformed into a hungry learner, eager to fail, learn, and improve. By seizing the opportunity to take this course, I pushed myself beyond my limits. This experience and realization changed how I wanted to pursue the rest of high school, college, and life in general.\n\nI walked into my first day of the chemistry class expecting to walk out with an A; but thankfully, I didn’t. Instead, I walked out of that class with a taste of the college experience and a principle that I now live by-- that it is okay to fail, as long as you get back up.",

      "essay": "Understanding the past helps us make better choices in today’s society. History provides us with the views of people and politics, the ethnic origin of people, and much more. At the base of all history, there is an intensive culmination of research which hopes to address or bring light to a story.\n\nMy passion for history began while digging deep into own family’s story, researching the history of Latin America, and the origins of the city I was raised in.\n\nFor example, when I first saw my favorite show Avatar The Last Airbender, I spent hours researching the mythology of the show which in the process made me learn about the philosophy of China: daoism, Confucius, and the mandate of heaven. Anything can be put within a historical framework to understand the context; every decision, tv show, and law has a history and that is exactly what I love. History forces us to take into account the voices of the past before we can attempt to plan for the future.\n\nHistory has helped me become a more effective writer for the school paper. It has made me think like a attorney, revisiting old cases, and writing up a winning argument in a mock trial. Thinking like a historian has helped me make sense of the current political climate and motivated me to help start Students For Liberty, at my school’s campus where political ideologies are shared respectfully.\n\nLearning, about history drives my inquisitive nature — I demonstrated this desire by volunteering at a local museum to learn more about the origins of my community in Carson. Ultimately, learning about the Dominguez family who established the Harbor Area of LA.\n\nIn terms of academics and performance, I have passed both of my history AP exams in World and U.S. history — being the 2nd person in my school’s history to do so. Studying history in highschool has nurtured my love for social science, which I hope to continue in college and throughout my life.\n\n",

      "essay": "I always loved watching the worms when it rained. I used to put my little raincoat on, sit on the doorsteps, and watch them move toward the puddles. My younger brother, forever intent on destroying the world around him, would try to stomp on the worms, and I would run after him screaming. In my imagination, the brain looked like a pile of squiggly worms. However, my neuroscience curiosity has since grown beyond a worm’s habits.\n\n \n\nFor example, my mother thought that I was insane when I wanted to watch American Murder: The Family Next Door. To her immense relief, I was interested in the psychology of the criminal rather than the crime itself. Although neuroscience is my primary interest, I also hope to learn more about the intersection between law and medicine at the UPenn College of Arts and Sciences. I’ve been able to explore this topic through various projects at school such as presentations on juvenile crime and the death penalty.\n\n \n\nAt the University of Pennsylvania, I look forward to taking classes like Forensic Neuroscience (BIBB 050) as well as Neuroscience and Society (PSYC 247) both of which directly combine my two interests. Hopefully, the Take Your Professor to Dinner program resumes as I would make sure to talk to Dr. Daniel Langleben about his research on forensic functional brain imaging over a meal of Philly cheesesteaks.\n\n \n\nI also hope to participate in the Race, Science, and Society Program where I can discover how race biases and neuroscience go hand-in-hand and contribute to the fight against racism. The Beyond Arrests: Re-Thinking Systematic-Oppression Group immediately caught my attention while looking at Penn’s opportunities to engage in relevant dialogue. My fascination with the criminal system began with reading Fyodor Dostoevsky’s Crime and Punishment, and Penn will both fuel that curiosity as well as introduce new questions about the world of justice reform.\n\n \n\nAs an eight-year Latin scholar and a five-time reader of the Percy Jackson franchise, I would like to take classes in the Penn Classical Studies department where I can learn more about the impact of ancient cultures on society today. Classes such as Greek and Roman Medicine (CLST 271) would intersect my interests in medicine and classical civilizations.\n\n \n\nAlthough I do harbor a deep love for Philly cheesesteaks and enjoyment of running in strange places like the Woodlands Cemetery, the range of programs to support my diverse interests and unmatched opportunities to put learning into action make me confident that the University of Pennsylvania is the best university for me to succeed.",

      "essay": "In 9th grade, I made my most astonishing work of art.\n\n \n\nFunnily enough, it wasn’t for any class related to the arts. It was for my statistics class. I created it to answer a simple question: are people happier when they have more friends? To answer that question, my group and I surveyed 240 students. That month, the ink from my printer was running as dry as my body was soaked with sweat from running around the school collecting questionnaires. We compiled all results into a spreadsheet with hundreds of thousands of cells. It was the largest amount of data I had ever handled. I started analyzing it, cell by cell. The method of analysis? A node network graph. It was something new to me at the time and I didn’t know what to expect. The final result was an intensely vivid web of color composed of 240 nodes connected by thousands upon thousands of lines. It was magnificent to behold. It was intensely surreal as I witnessed the abstract concept of friendship manifested in something tangible and visual. This chaotic and hypnotizing mess of dots and lines was a snapshot of the relationships between an entire batch of students! From the graph, I could immediately discern that people aren’t automatically happier if they have more friends. It’s the quality of your friendships that matter. Ever since that project, I have been constantly seeking new ways to make the invisible structures around us visible.\n\n \n\nOver the years, this interest has driven me to study the effects of the internet in greater depth. This is because the internet, for the past few decades, has been the biggest black box that our society has ever created. It has been credited for both promoting democracy and blamed for destroying it. It has been praised for spreading information, and decried for spreading misinformation. All of the confusion surrounding what the internet actually is stems mostly from the fact that it’s very hard to see the full extent of how it actually works and how it affects people. Media coverage of Google’s use of data or Facebook’s Cambridge Analytica scandal, services I use every day, have left me wondering how we can improve the internet and make it more transparent for the people who use it.\n\n \n\nAs a policy-minded thinker and problem solver, I have done a lot of research and contemplation on the current problems and benefits of these platforms and services. I read about how Youtube has served as a platform for populist strongmen. I read about how Facebook enabled the Arab Spring. So far, all that I have learned is that the problem is an incredibly complex and nuanced one, with a lot of different actors and moving parts. It involves multinational companies, governments, and billions of individual users. In order to maximize the potential of these networks and minimize their harms, we have to be tactical in our approach. From figuring out data privacy to figuring out whether these companies are platforms or basic services, almost all aspects of the role of these networks fascinate me. It is also a topic that I have debated competitively in the past. I have participated in motions ranging from “This house would ban Google from retaining search data” to “This house believes news media outlets should use AI for the production and presentation of its news content”. I am highly invested in the role of social networks in today’s society; rather than their complexity pushing me away, it is what draws me in. \n\n \n\nThe costs of not understanding social networks in this era is incredibly high. This is why I am willing to dedicate myself to studying it and uncovering the ways of how to deal with it. ",

Certamen is like Latin jeopardy with questions themed after classical history, mythology, translation, and grammar. A familiar feeling of competition surges through me each time my teammate of three years and I start a game of Certamen. With our handy doorbell buzz button and endless knowledge of Latin derivatives, we currently maintain a three-year Certamen win streak that I intend to keep until I graduate.

My imminent desire to ‘respond’ cowered back into its hole. But maybe I didn’t have to reply. Because curiosity prefaces career and we all have varying definitions of both. Maybe the reason why our choices are challenged is to test if we would hold on to them. This tiny incident taught me 2 crucial lessons- A: Silence is a sign of maturity, not cowardice, and B: Having faith governs the prowess to excel. The next day when I met my friend, I simply smiled and said “The reason we can converse critically is because someone taught us the alphabet. Maybe being a teacher isn’t a bad idea after all.”",

      "essay": "During the earliest stages of my Political club, I was faced with a question by a peer. The club was in a discussion about gun laws in the US and what everyone’s view was on the topic. This specific student seemed very passionate about the issue and made it known that he wanted guns in this country. He began citing examples with store owners protecting themselves from armed robberies and overall self defense in general. He was well versed in the topic but that came to my realization once he asked me what my view was. I subconsciously knew guns were destructive, of course they were, and I wanted to state that. But I couldn’t think of any evidence to support myself. I wasn’t educated in the issue of guns in America other than my raw opinion of guns being “bad”. \n\nBut experiences like this motivated me to take that step, I wanted to educate myself on this issue that plunders America. Instead of conforming to his view, I took this opportunity to establish my own foundation and learn of the different instances in our history that would support my opinion. I versed myself in information from resources on the Internet and finally came to my club ready for discussion. But it didn’t end in the transformation of any opinions, instead he understood my judgment and respected it. When challenged with this perspective against my own, I’ve learned that with enough evidence and research, any opinion can be deemed correct. ",

When a patient was agitated that he couldn’t get out of his wheelchair, I rushed to his side, calmly encouraging him while nurses helped the patient get on his feet.

      "essay": "X was an ugly letter. It was a cross-out, an error, a rebel. Nothing started with X except for xylophone and X-men. And my name.\n\nIt was in first grade, in my third year living in the United States, that I realized how ghastly “Xinxin Zhang” sounded on American lips. The teacher pronounced it “Zin-zin Zang,” and my classmates followed suit. My name was supposed to mean “warm-hearted,” and was to be spoken in a soft tone: “Shin-shin Jahn.” But the letters hardened on the English tongue, and along with them, my heart. I alienated the name that had alienated me, attempting to anglicize myself with the name “Grace.” I left Xinxin behind; she belonged to China, not my new life in America.\n\nOver the next few years, Xinxin was systematically purged from my identity. I pronounced my last name in the same, calcified “Zang” that my American classmates did. I put aside Chinese characters in exchange for English letters. I suppressed anything that associated me with my heritage, repudiated anything that forced me to acknowledge my immigrant status. After gaining citizenship in ninth grade, I even took the opportunity to legally change my name to Grace, confining Xinxin to be a little-mentioned middle name. Mostly, it would appear as a singular letter ‘X’ when I signed my name—if I signed with it at all.\n\nIt’s impossible for me to pinpoint an exact moment when cultural pride occurred to me: it was a gradual phenomenon, starting with a transfer to a new school where international students gossiped and argued and joked and complained in Chinese. Even the girls’ laughs and gestures seemed distinctly Chinese, quietly graceful in a way that I longed to imitate. But there was no way to gracefully join a foreign conversation by speaking English; the warm-hearted Xinxin and my nearly-forgotten Mandarin vocabulary was my only way to connect with these new students. So I found myself fighting for the “warm-hearted” girl I had lost, speaking Chinese in a tongue that felt too thick to pronounce the delicate language. I wrote shaky characters in a hand unfamiliar with Chinese radicals and downloaded WeChat, China’s biggest social media platform. From then on, I insisted on communicating solely in Mandarin on WeChat, texting both my new friends and my parents in their mother language, despite my messages being littered with homophonic errors.\n\nNow, their mother language is my language too. Not only can I carry a conversation, but I can also banter with the international students, trading quips and insults as they do. When I traveled to China in the summer before senior year, no one suspected of me being anything other than a local. I have even begun to pick up on reading basic characters (though my parents insist I stop texting them in Chinese until I learn the character difference between “prostitute” and ”clock”). I am no longer “Grace,” but “Grace Xinxin Zhang”—pronounced “Shin-shin Jahn,” of course.\n\nMy acceptance of my background is an integral part of my coming-of-age. I am not just Grace, but neither am I just Xinxin. My identity is more than just who I choose to be at any given time. It’s a legacy that’s been passed down through generations in China, from forefathers who served as generals in the Han dynasty, to grandfathers who secretly learned English during Mao Zedong’s Cultural Revolution, to me, a girl whose first memory of her parents was through a computer screen, separated from them by the Atlantic Ocean as they pursued doctorates in the United States. Xinxin would unite with them at four years old. She would reintegrate into the Zhang family at age 16.\n\nX is so much more than an error. It’s a bridge between America and China, between Grace and Zhang. X is an embracement of my identity.\n\n",

      "essay": "After devouring Lewis Carrolls’ masterpiece, my world shifted off its axis. I transformed into Alice, and my favorite place, the playground, became Wonderland. I would gallivant around, marveling at flowers and pestering my parents with questions, murmuring, “Curiouser and curiouser.” If Alice’s “Drink Me” potion was made out of curiosity, I drank liters of it. Alice, along with fairytale retellings like the Land of Stories by Chris Colfer, kickstarted my lifelong love of reading. \n\nEspecially when I was younger, reading brought me solace when the surrounding world was filled with madness (and sadly, not like the fun kind in Alice in Wonderland). There are so many nonsensical things that happen in the world, from shootings at a movie theater not thirty minutes from my home, to hate crimes targeted towards elderly Asians. Reading can be a magical escape from these problems, an opportunity to clear one’s mind from chaos. \n \nAs I got older, reading remained an escape, but also became a way to see the world and people from a new perspective. I can step into so many different people’s shoes, from a cyborg mechanic (Cinder), to a blind girl in WWII’s France (Marie-Laure, All the Light We Cannot See). Sure, madness is often prevalent in these worlds too, but reading about how these characters deal with it helps me deal with our world’s madness, too. \n\nReading also transcends generational gaps, allowing me to connect to my younger siblings through periodic storytimes. Reading is timeless — something I’ll never tire of. ",

It always seemed like her art ended up praised and framed, while mine ended up in the trash can when I wasn’t looking. In contrast to my sister, art always came as a bit of a struggle for me. My bowls were lopsided and my portraits looked like demons. Many times, I’ve wanted to scream and quit art once and for all. I craved my parents’ validation, a nod of approval or a frame on the wall. \n\nEventually, my art improved, and I made some of my favorite projects, from a ceramic haunted house to mushroom salt-and-pepper shakers. Even then, I didn’t get much praise from my parents, but I realized I genuinely loved art. It wasn’t something I enjoyed because of others’ praise; I just liked creating things of my own and the inexplicable thrill of chasing a challenge. Art has taught me to love failing miserably at something to continue it again the next day. If I never endured countless Bob Ross tutorials, I never would’ve made the mountain painting that I hang in my room today; if I never made pottery that blew up (just once!), I wouldn’t have my giant ceramic pie. \n\nI’m still light years from being an expert, but I’ll never tire of the kick of a challenge.

While I couldn’t watch the cartoon, fixing the TV not only made me happy, but it also piqued my interest in the digital world.

I assigned each student a caretaker, another student with whom they were unfamiliar, and required them to look after him / her for the entire week, which included telling stories, buying snacks in the canteen, jogging together, and so on. However, because some people would not accept this game in the first place, I spoke to the tastemakers in the class before introducing it so that they could persuade others.\n\nEverything went as planned; some students who couldn’t even interact before ended up in relationships.

      "essay": "Since my childhood, I wanted success in America, a desire shared by many first generation children of immigrants, but as an Indian male I convinced myself that the only way to attain this was through complete assimilation. I found ways to pick and prod at some of the most unjust aspects of Indian society and used that as enough justification to reject my culture altogether. I wanted to be American and I felt that the Indian accent, the Indian food, and just about everything “Indian” about me had to go. In my quest to become “American”, I almost lost a sense of who I am.\n\nThroughout elementary school, I was identified as Indian, yet I tirelessly attempted to prevent this. On cultural awareness day in first grade, when asked what nationality I was, I proudly proclaimed “American,” to everyone’s surprise. By this time, I had lost the accent entirely, yet there was still enough “evidence” that I was Indian. My mother packed me a traditional Indian lunch every morning and every afternoon I would bring home untouched food. After enough scolding from her, I would make sure that I brought none of the food back by tossing it in the cafeteria garbage. I look back and wonder why I was so obsessed with destroying every tiny bit of “Indian” in me, for none of my peers nor my teachers recognized nor congratulated my efforts. I was locked in an identity conflict. There was no denying who I truly was, but I felt that I needed to change that in order to fit in.\n\nIn middle school, I had gained the reputation of being the most “Americanized” Indian in school. My friends would marvel at my complete detachment from my culture. I would pretend to not understand my parents when they spoke to me in Gujarati in public. I would always mark English as my first and only language spoken at home. I would always express my distaste for Indian dishes when engaged in conversation about ethnic food, although I secretly devoured the traditional biryani and makhni chicken whenever my mother would prepare it.\n\nDuring the summer of 2012, my family and I travelled to London to attend a relative’s wedding. To my surprise, I was introduced to my cousins, who although possessing respectable educational degrees, speaking with a British accent, in interracial marriages, and mingling with British friends, embraced the cultural richness of India. The wedding displayed all the cultural rites and rituals with traditional Indian food and delicacies, while the reception that followed had a totally westernized flare. All the guests had a great time and I realized that there was a creative way in which the two cultures engaged in conflict within me could integrate.\n\nAnother turning point for me occurred during my research internship at Yale’s School of Medicine. There was a great amount of cultural diversity that existed in the research atmosphere and I found myself meeting people of various nationalities. Obviously, people of similar cultural backgrounds tended to aggregate, but I found it amazing that during lunch hour everyone, regardless of nationality, would socialize over the various ethnic foods available from street-side vendors. This epitomized the “melting- pot” of cultures that America is. I met highly regarded professors, doctorates, and medical students who despite their successes in America still relished in their cultures openly and even embraced each other’s cultures.\n\nIt was at this point that I realized that there was no embarrassment or shame in expressing my culture. For too long had I suppressed my culture due to my flawed interpretation of how success is attained in America. There was nothing advantageous in trying to fit the portrait of a “generic” American, for such a portrait is a fallacy. My identity is Indian and American – in fact, I now like to think that I’m the best of both worlds.\n\n",

As the Vice President of the Puente Club, a TRIO program, I developed an Academic Outreach Committee to provide study skills to marginalized students. I also co-founded the Young Scholars of Salinas Club, Young SOS, which allowed me to share college readiness information with 49 of my peers. Every weekend, I volunteer for the Emanyatta Saturday School, a program designed to provide African American youth with additional academic support and cultural enrichment. I am passionate about serving in disenfranchised neighborhoods, and I look forward to participating in both Civic Scholars and Alternative Breaks.\n\nThis summer, I had the privilege of traveling to South Africa with The Experiment Leadership Institute to learn about peace politics and human rights. This five-week experience has inspired me to view systems in America through a new lens. Like America, South Africa is dealing with the unhealed scars of racism on a society that is attempting to be post-racial. Like Americans, South Africans tarry in a society in which extreme wealth is constantly juxtaposed with extreme poverty. Like America, South Africa is still suffering from the long-lasting effects of imperialism. This trip has sparked a desire to study abroad in order to be exposed to new cultures and to examine the political history of other countries.\n\nA key component of being educated is knowing your own history. As a Black girl, my experience has been limited to courses like AP European History and AP US History, which blatantly disregard the African diaspora and the long term effects it has had on people of African descent globally. I was excited to find out that UPENN offers an Africana Studies Pre-Freshman Summer Institute that fosters a sense of community and provides a broader picture of the Black experience.\n\nAn important part of college is social interaction. With the increase in social media, we have seen a decrease in social awareness. Many adults have lost their ability to hold a conversation, and many adolescents have never possessed it. TableTalk Penn is appealing because it affords the opportunity to have difficult, yet thought-provoking conversations. UPENN is seen as an impetus for engaging in discourse for the purpose of solving real-world issues. I believe the collaborative spirit at UPENN combined with the diverse student body will help me to develop the leadership skills I will need to pursue a career in law and politics.",

      "essay": "Penn’s vast research opportunities, service-learning mission, and flexible curriculum offer me manifold opportunities to explore different disciplines and to forge my own path. What differentiates Penn from many other universities is that it encourages academic breadth, allowing its students to enroll in courses at its other schools. I am currently interested in various subjects so I plan on acquiring another minor(s)—potentially ASL and Deaf Studies, Landscape Studies, Consumer Psychology, and/or the Biological Basis of Behavior and Health Service Management—in addition to my Mathematics major. It is incredibly refreshing and relieving to know that I am not restricted to one specific discipline or school for all four years of my undergraduate; starting freshman year, I can simultaneously enroll in an engrossing, rigorous math course – MATH 116, for example – at the College and also take an assortment of classes pertaining to my interests at Wharton or the School of Design.\n\nSince deafness is an integral component of my identity, I am particularly interested in expanding research on its connection to music through Penn’s Undergraduate Research Mentoring Program (PURM) or the completion of an ASL minor. I am uncertain of what I will eventually choose to do, but I hope that a faculty member in PURM, an optimal program for me since I have minimal formal research experience, will also be interested in conducting research on music and deafness, or on a closely-related topic. The research skills and knowledge I gain from PURM will prepare me well for the Capstone ABCS course, LING 077, of the ASL minor, which allows me to meet and interact with the Deaf community in Philadelphia. I am deeply attracted by Penn’s emphasis on community involvement because I want to serve others, using my education with a purpose and for a greater good, and to apply my knowledge beyond the boundaries of a traditional classroom setting.\n\nAs for extracurriculars, I plan to continue and expand on my high school involvements at Penn. I love playing tennis and staying active so I will join Penn’s club tennis team. I am also passionate about my Korean heritage so I plan on joining the Korean Student Association in order to promote cultural awareness at Penn and earnestly invite other students to learn more about it. I will also found a club dedicated to music and service—something similar to my youth ensemble—or become involved with the Civic House. These are just a few of the ways I will engage myself on and off of Penn’s campus, but I am considering joining a different extracurricular, one that I have never done before, since Penn offers so many opportunities to try and learn something new.\n\nFinally, traveling to new places is one of my favorite things to do because I love learning about how other countries’ cultures and beliefs differ from those of America. I plan to combine my passions for traveling and academia by applying to one of the numerous Penn Abroad programs. In addition to studying abroad, I am strongly considering the International Internships Placement, another way for me to learn more about deafness and its influence on communities outside of America. The internship would preferably take place in a hospital, for I might want to become a doctor specializing in ears, although this career plan is not set in stone: I am aware of the possibility that my career interests may shift at Penn, where I will be exposed to new ideas, disciplines, and perspectives. Even if that happens, I firmly believe that Penn’s diverse resources and challenging, yet stimulating undergraduate experience will help me to achieve my goals and to give back to the community. I look forward to learning from renowned professors and my inspirational peers, serving the community, whether it be in Philadelphia or in an international location, and exploring the vibrant city with my friends during the next four years.",

      "essay": "Whenever I’m asked what I want to study in college, I can always confidently answer “business”. But it’s the follow-up question of, “what type of business?” where I always find myself at a loss for words. I know I thrive through leadership and creativity, and I know I want to bring more social awareness to the field of business. So where does that lead me?\n\nIn a perfect world, it leads me to Wharton, where I have the opportunity to explore every avenue and branch of business that I hope to gain exposure to. I will combine my business-minded focus and ambitious drive with my love of art, taking around a third of my classes in the liberal arts, a distinctive quality about an institution as prestigious as Penn. Beyond just “business,” I will major in Management while specializing in Entrepreneurship and Innovation, to build the business I’ve always dreamed of running, and I will complete a secondary concentration in Social Impact and Responsibility.\n\nI’m especially excited to take Management 100, drawn by the social aspect and independence of such a unique opportunity for freshmen along with the chance for real client interaction. Ever since reading about him in Fortune’s 40 under 40 a few years ago, I’ve also been extremely eager to study under Adam Grant, drawn to his promotion of leadership and collaboration while maintaining a dedication to non-profit work. With Penn’s Lunch and Learn, and other mentorship opportunities, I love how integrated the professors and students at Penn are.\n\nDriven by personal ambition and a never-ending stream of ideas, I’ve always been drawn to entrepreneurship. Penn’s Social Entrepreneurship Movement is the program that will help me launch my own social impact initiative and build up real-world consultation experience before my plans of pursuing consulting upon graduation. During my campus visit, I came across Penn International Impact Consulting and was immediately fascinated by the combination of consulting and sustainability.\n\nI recently spent a summer with Bank of America’s Student Leader program, actively learning about corporate philanthropy from CEOs of the top businesses around the country and participating in an internship where the crossroads of business and non-profit meet. Those experiences motivated me to dive into the world of the social impact and responsibilities of businesses, from local startups to global corporations. Through Wharton’s Social Impact Initiative, participating in programs such as Wharton Social Impact Advisory Board, I will be able to experience change even at the undergraduate level- an opportunity that is unmatched at any other school. This is the mindset I will take with me as I build a strong educational foundation to one day own my own business that will inspire change through its philanthropic practices.\n\nHaving grown up in a multicultural home and intently studying Spanish as a foreign language in school, I will continue my international experiences on a larger scale through studying abroad and the Wharton International Program, particularly in Argentina. Between the Wharton Leadership Ventures and Penn Wharton Entrepreneurship, I love Penn’s emphasis on hands-on and interactive engagement in addition to a traditional classroom involvement- especially as someone who is constantly seeking active and unconventional experiences.\n\nAdditionally, I will build skills in my other areas of interest such as graphic design and writing, both of which I can also incorporate into the business aspects. Through the Kelly Writers House and through taking a Design or Typography course, I can supplement my curriculum with additional skills that both peak my interests and can benefit my core education.\n\nBeyond the classroom walls. I will fully take advantage of Penn’s vast network of connections, obtaining industry experience in consulting or management prior to graduation. Whether it is within the Penn campus, overseas studying in Europe, or as a Social Impact Intern, I know Penn will be the perfect place for me to thrive and grow both my educational and social experiences.",

      "essay": "I’d been disappointing myself at tennis tournaments for years. My coaches constantly said that my rankings were lower than my talent level. We thought it was a simple fix—a sports psychologist would do the trick. Eight visits later, my results were still terrible. What was I doing wrong?\n\nThe answer was right in front of me: when things got tough, I gave up. It was a way to protect myself from upsetting setbacks. To me, losing without giving effort was better than trying and still failing.\n\nThankfully, my coach took notice. Before lessons, he reminded me that I wouldn’t remember losses in the future—I would remember my character. If I didn’t put the effort in now, I would have to live knowing I had squandered my talents. That would be worse than the pain of failure.\n\nCoach’s words stung. I was the one holding myself back. I wasn’t putting in the work during training. I didn’t believe in myself because I never gave myself a reason to.\n\n“Better starts right now,” has become my personal motto, one that has halved my national ranking in less than 12 months. Whether it’s the end of a tournament, the end of my tennis career, or the end of my life, I want to know I achieved the most I could. After hard matches, I no longer have any regrets. Yes, failure sucks. But if I sacrifice everything and still come back with an L, there’s nothing left to say other than “well played.”",

Thus, I initiated ‘Headway Campaign’, a peer-run mental health platform that provides emotional support to high school students, whilst attempting to mitigate the stigma attached around seeking help. I rallied together a team of four volunteers to get professional training in listening under Dr Samir Parikh. Leveraging social media and an online portal, we have been able to reach 26 students through workshops and peer support groups at school to extend a safe listening space and a consequent first port of support.\n\nThis experience has given me a strong sense of accomplishment and satisfaction.",

      "essay": "We were supposed to win it all my freshman year. The tennis team had finished 6th at State the year before, and expectations were even higher this time around. I was a rookie, but I needed to have the maturity of a senior.\n\nOne day, I sat on the bleachers at the end of practice, shielding my face to hide my tears. I felt intimidated by everyone, all the pressure that came with being a part of a “super team.” I needed someone to lean on. Thankfully, the team was there for me.\n\nFrom the beginning, our captains led by example. They weren’t afraid of emotions—rather, they embraced them. When the team felt nervous, our captains used that adrenaline to help us power through matches. When the team felt unmotivated, our captains weren’t afraid to push us, even when our legs were cramping up from long practice matches.\n\nDedication and acceptance defined their leadership.\n\nI’ve learned much more from the captains than just how to lead a tennis team. In every situation, I aspire to match their unfailing honesty, tenacity, and ability to aid others in any way possible. I take pride in helping the people around me do their best, whether it’s perfecting their new forehand or absolutely nailing their next speech. I hope to inspire others to do the same for their peers, and I aim to welcome everyone into my life. As Captain Martin used to say, “Anyone can be your family.”",

One day my Spanish teacher even had me lead the class in aerobic exercises to help stop the glum, melancholy mood. I don’t have an off switch; I am go go go all the time. I apply this attribute very effectively to my athletics. During every single sprint and every single play, I maximize my effort. In fact, the football staff created a new helmet sticker due to my energy – the “POW” sticker. My team was about to face the most challenging team yet, and all week the coaches stressed the importance of communication and positive attitude. That week I screamed out the scout team’s offenses; I ran from station to station; and I patted my teammates on their backs when they made huge plays. I was a blazing inferno of enthusiasm. In light of my exuberance, when the coach passed out stickers for our accomplishments, he announced how a new sticker had been created. I helped my team not by making a monstrous hit, not by running for a touchdown, but for whooping, hollering, and elevating everybody’s level of play.\n\n",

At first my parents and I were not alarmed, but the doctors explained that if I did not undergo surgery, I would be in a wheelchair by age thirty. My parents decided that having surgery as soon as possible would be my best option. Recovering from the surgery was my hardship. I was required to be in a wheelchair with full leg casts for three months, casts to my knees for an additional three months, walking casts for two more months, and hinged leg braces for yet another two months. After this ten-month span I had lost my ability to even walk; I required a walker just to be mobile. After several months of physical therapy, I finally began to run again. I knew then that I wanted to use my legs to their fullest potential. That life event gave me the competitive drive instilled in me today. Thanks to that surgery I have learned commitment and teamwork both on the football field as well as on the track. I continue pushing my body to its limits today due to my little Achilles tendons that could.",

With this skill I have had the privilege of dreaming big. I have dreamed of leaving the village, leaving the county, or even leaving the state. Moving outside of Ohio is almost unheard of in my area; nearly all graduates settle back into [Redacted] or very close by. My parents have never limited me to the norm, though. When I had aspirations of being a lawyer in a huge city, they didn’t tell me to stay grounded. They told me to dream bigger and aim higher. They insisted that I needed to push myself to reach my lofty goals because nothing would be handed to me. So while others didn’t care if they received a B on the test or if they didn’t grasp the material, I strived for perfection. I knew that I had the ability to make an impact on this world with dedication, determination, and some loving support. I learned all these attributes and more from my family.",

My quotes have served as inspirations, reminders of my core values, sources of a good laugh, and as conversation starters for friends who stop by my room. I hope they’ll do the same for you.\n\nCan’t wait to meet you!\n\n-Sophia",

For me, photography is only one of those ways to cement events eternally. Nowadays, photography is so advanced and capable that tweaks and styles can advance pictures and videos into works of art that contain significance.\n\nCombine this with my proclivity to play around with phones and their software. Modern-day phones have excellent cameras, but they can be enhanced through app development that can enable portraits, longer exposure times, and other DSLR features. Starting out in this discipline is a great way to understand how software collaborates with hardware to predicate the outcome known as the “photo”.\n\nThe possibilities with photos are endless. The vast amount of nature and establishments in the world makes it easy to capture memories that will last a lifetime. Newer developments, such as low light photos and astrophotography, make the quest for change even more interesting.\n\nAlthough nascent, these features are open-sourced for amateur developers like me. Basic knowledge is enough to significantly enhance phone cameras and take photos that contain a deeper meaning with all of its colors, blurs, and contrasts. The amalgamation of photography and computer science has provided for an interactive experience that allows me to consistently learn while pursuing a separate, and seemingly unrelated, artistic hobby. It is one of the few times where I am able to engage both sides of my brain in something I enjoy.",

      "essay": "Despite decades of research on the human brain, it is still one of the most primitive areas of understanding within all scientific disciplines. The brain is everso complex; the connections between different parts of the system create an interactive experience that guides abstract thought, intensive emotions, and rigorous decisions. The rudimentary framework of brain interlinkages has led to the emergence of advanced machine learning in computer science. Harnessing the power of computers to provide computations in a brain-like manner is getting increasingly efficient, helping to solve problems like never before.\n\nI discovered machine learning when looking through my brother’s computer a few years ago. He was working on a project for one of his undergraduate courses and the term itself fascinated me. I knew about simple coding and had done some small projects, but such a complex topic gave me hope for far-reaching, future endeavors. Combine this with my love for biological systems and the brain: learning how living objects functions is fascinating and allows for deeper reflection into one’s own body. In AP Psychology, I learned all about the brain, neurons, and connections that make the brain so special.\n\nThe combination of these two interests instilled a fire within me that continues to burn to this day. Machine learning is sophisticated in itself, but my passion drives me to explore. I never expect to fully understand the concept; rather, the proposition of eternal learning makes the experience all the more gratifying.",

As I shuffle forward in line, I consider how the TSA could provide more security with less hassle.\n\nEven before I started designing game theory algorithms, I had a passion for turning my ideas into physical reality, mapping my thoughts onto the world to create something that didn’t exist before. I built all sorts of elaborate contraptions, from enhancements to toy cars to blueprints for flying wooden planes. I dreamed of becoming an inventor like my childhood hero, Thomas Edison. I am most content when immersed in this process of conceiving ideas and then constantly testing and improving them until they become fruitful.\n\nWhen I was nine, I discovered computer programming – the unlikely result of constantly nagging my father for a Game Boy. He promised me one if I could program a working Markov Decision Process solver for an undergraduate class he was teaching, assuming it would never happen. Determined to earn it, I spent a few hours each day teaching myself to program. At first, no matter how many bugs I found, countless others would keep my program from running. But in hopes that my Game Boy was within reach, I worked nonstop, line-by-line, test after test, until my program began to spit out the right answer. To my dad’s surprise, I successfully built the program and spent the next week glued to my Game Boy, and the next eight years glued to programming.\n\nWhen I create algorithms today, I tackle problems too mathematically complex for our brains to process alone, but too nuanced for a computer, being a mere automaton. The variables in the security dilemmas I try to solve include a different value for each target, the adversary’s possible attacks, and the range of possible patrol routes. A good defense strategy must account for every scenario, and though this can overwhelm a human mind, it’s much easier with the right computer algorithm. I work at the intersection of these capacities, grappling with problems neither man nor machine can accomplish alone. It’s in the midst of this process, expressing my ideas in the form of code, that I feel perfectly content, because my creativity is truly at work.\n\nDesigning algorithms feels like an art to me: my medium, a typewriter-font cursor blinking on an empty Python shell, is a blank canvas, containing no inner meaning of its own, but rather an unlimited number of possibilities. When an elegant program starts working, I feel as accomplished as an artist who has just finished his last brushstroke. I am an artist, and my art can solve problems as mundane as algebra homework or as vital as the security of critical infrastructure. From choreographing the patrol boats that dance around the Staten Island ferry, to protecting foreign aid deliveries from theft, my research has unlimited potential to revitalize the security domain.\n\nWhen I took up algorithm design, I found a new realm of possibility to channel my creativity and help advance the state of the art in math and computer science. I hope that one day, it will be my algorithms thwarting threats to LAX.",

      "essay": "I’m motivated by challenges and often see unanswered questions as challenges. One of the questions that I explored in my Theory of Knowledge class last year was whether or not it is possible to find a universal scale for ethics. The conclusion that there are legions of unsolvable ethical problems did not deter me but instead piqued my interest.\n\nI feel that there is value in exploring ethical beliefs because they make up the core of a person; every decision is charged with ethical implications and in that sense, ethics govern all journeys, past, present, and future. I’m excited by conversations about ethics because each one uncovers new, uncharted territory, a fresh perspective on the issue.\n\nOne of my favorite ethical debates is that between fate and free will; is it ethical to deny the right to free will in the interest of future benefit? When initially posed to me, I was asked whether it would be moral to keep individuals who carry genetic disorders from reproducing. This would theoretically have utilitarian benefit, improving the gene pool of future generations. But in denying the right to free will, do we lose the diversity, variation, and imperfections that constitute the human experience? And how much do we value our perception of the human experience, is life more or less valuable when imperfections have been stripped away and all variables are controlled? These questions are the beauty in concepts that are so complex and nuanced that they are unanswerable.",

      "essay": "My favourite quote, the one that I always find myself going back to when I need some inspiration is “what will survive of us is love”. It comes from the poem An Arundel Tomb by Philip Larkin. The poem depicts a scene of travelers from across the world going to see the tomb of an earl and countess. The primary message conveyed is that the personalities of the deceased have been wiped away by the nature of time. The poem ends with the line, “what will survive of us is love”, meaning that only human connection can transverse through time, you will be remembered only through the ways in which you positively influence those around you.\n\nThe study of tragedy and philosophy in English class, paired with the study of war and conflict in History class, have led me to value the finite time that humans have on Earth. Given this, I believe in spending as much time as possible being happy and making others happy. Larkin’s quote speaks to me because it eloquently encompasses my values. It discusses how what is truly important about human nature is our actions, that power from class, authority, and status don’t stand the test of time, but the way we treat one another will.\n\nComing from an author who is known for his cynicism, Larkin’s poem is a testament to the power of human connection and interaction. This power never fails to amaze me, to empower me, and inspire me to leave a legacy through the way I treat others.",

      "essay": "Past the quad, past the staff lounge, and behind the gymnasium, a portable building squats at the edge of the soccer field. This brown blemish houses the Resource Education Department, commonly referred to as “special needs.” I first entered that building through my school’s Buddy Lunch program, which unites general and resource education students together. The students that I have met through this program enjoy interacting with the broader school community, but their segregation from “mainstream” students deprives them of this opportunity.\n\nThis marginalization resonates deeply with me because my cousin Nina has intellectual disabilities. She and I are so similar, apart from an infinitesimal neurological difference that supposedly warrants us being considered “completely different.” She deserves the same level of kindness and respect that she has always shown to others.\n\nMany of my peers flippantly use words like “retard” and “autistic,” unaware that even the term “special needs” has a negative connotation. No one deserves this degradation; I have worked to educate my peers to make the campus more accommodating and comfortable for students with intellectual disabilities.\n\nI hope to continue challenging stereotypes of those with learning disabilities. As a child, I never intuitively differentiated between myself and people with intellectual disabilities; this is something that happened only after others pointed out differences. I want to be a part of the generation that achieves a full, ethical representation of people with learning disabilities. The only cure for ignorance is education and exposure.\n\n",

As the textbook was not helping me at all, I found a brilliant video online that helped students memorize the entire periodic table. Using this song, I was able to make the impossible happen, and was able to demonstrate my knowledge of the periodic table.\n\nWhen I united my academics with something I truly enjoy—music and the arts—I was able to learn much more effectively. I took a subject matter that I was not as proficient in and manipulated my interests and resources to thrive. Two years after I initially took the class, I can still recite a majority of the periodic elements from memory. In fact, whenever my teachers assign creative projects, I jump out of my seat in excitement. Art is my passion, and creativity is my forte. I unite my love for the arts with my academics to streamline the learning process: singing eases memorization, while illustration improves my ability to visualize ideas. My passion for the arts has lent itself to my academic curiosity.\n\n“…ununseptium, ununoctium. And then we’re done!”",

Soon after, we were also interviewing students whose parents fear vaccination, administrators who enforce California’s strict vaccination laws, and science teachers who facilitate challenging discussions about the charged subject.\n\nWe broached formidable journalistic ethical questions: how do we maintain sources’ anonymity without sacrificing credibility? How do we acknowledge scientifically brless opinions without providing a platform and legitimacy? How can we try to remain objective on such a charged issue? Are we doing enough to counterbalance our biases?\n\nTime and time again, my experiences as a student journalist have allowed me to take my classroom learning and run with it. I go beyond what is being taught in class and seek out primary sources in my school and local community. My endless questions in the classroom mature into thought-provoking interview inquiries.

      "essay": "The sterile neutrino.\n\nIt was like trying to catch and study a bullet traveling at 400 m/s using a wet piece of tissue paper.\n\nOriginally a ‘desperate attempt’ to explain the violation of conservation laws in beta-\n\ndecay, the neutrino has a history of anomaly. Neutrinos interact exclusively via the weak force, so interaction is rare–making them nearly impossible to detect. Following the first detector discovery, physicists worked for almost a century to create a non-\n\ncontradictory understanding of these elusive leptons. This Standard Model description was supported time after time by experimental data, leading the world to believe that theorists had triumphed–until now. Another conflicting piece of evidence has arisen… But I intend to crack it.\n\nRecent experiments on the LSND reveal substantial evidence suggesting an additional flavor of neutrino. Under the guidance of Dr. Patricia Vahle, I am designing a sensitivity study for a potential Fermilab experiment to discover this new “sterile neutrino”, requiring the testing of the efficiency and purity of thousands of simulations. The hefty PDG Review of Particle Physics is already my lifeline, and my nights are quickly becoming consumed with hours of often frustrating bash scripting.\n\nThe subatomic world of flavor eigenstates and unstable decay is strange, but understanding is worth the effort; fresh inconsistency is too good to pass up. I have learned that my place in particle physics is in the challenge–widening the fissures in reality is okay with me. In fact, probing the unknown is the very force that drives my intellectual engine.",

Interestingly enough, this disorder is home to me.\n\nFrom my teacher’s violent book throws to his obsession with ​Invisible Man​, my English class is an exotic jungle. As chaotic as it may seem, the class gives me peace. The environment encourages everyone to be themselves, roam free, and discuss “uncomfortable” topics. Everyone’s screaming allows us to express our opinions and who we are without any judgement.\n\nThrough the diverse readings, I changed my perspective on the world. Fictional characters who rejected conformity helped me step outside my comfort zone. While Holden Caulfield gave away his prized hunting hat, I matured alongside him. ​Invisible Man​ (not “​The​”) taught me that accepting traumas of the past can actually make one a victor, and not a victim.\n\nWith this, my English class ignited a passion for learning and changed my perspective on education and even myself. I wasn’t going to school because I ​had​ to, but rather, I began arriving with a hunger for learning.

Denying a moment in life is denying a part of one’s self. I’ve been through many struggles and failures, as well; however, it’s what I do with them that makes me become physically, mentally, and emotionally stronger, and I’d hope to spark this realization within the Brown community.\n\nAlong with participating in Science Olympiad and Relay for Life in high school, it would be a pleasure to establish a Health Occupations Students of America team (HOSA), an organization that participates in real life medical projects, ranging from nutrition to medical spellings. I was even a state qualifier for the Dental Terminology event. HOSA introduced me to careers in medicine I never knew existed and students with similar interests.\n\nBeyond the scope of Brown University, Providence provides countless opportunities to serve the community. The Swearer Center provides the Community Sport Fellowship, which will allow me to teach students how to swim. The Royce Fellowship will help me further pursue my passion for research. These organizations will allow me to keep a pulse on the community as a whole while still exploring my interests.",

Does a right answer in art even exist? One cannot simply input colors and lines into a formula and compute an output of art. Instead of scholars like Isaac Newton and René Descartes, art comes from within oneself. Like solving a derivative formula to find the slope of a tangent on a curve, mixing colors, lines, shapes, and hues never results to inaccuracy. Art is a realm where I can’t be defined by a closed interval and its brackets. It transforms something so extraneous and odd into something tangible yet mysterious. Art doesn’t have an indefinite integral, but rather an open interval. The limit doesn’t exist in art, but rather resembles a continuous and differentiable curve that has infinite solutions.\n\n",

      "essay": "I have had a fascination with the people, languages and cultures of Spain since middle school, when I would watch Spanish professional soccer on television. These were my heroes, who dangled a ball before their opponents as though it was a matador’s cape. The rivalries between soccer teams was my window into the regional mosaic of Spanish culture. The most remarkable team, F.C. Barcelona, was the all consuming passion of proud and prosperous Catalunya. The team Athletic Bilbao of the Basque country, though typically no match for the Catalans, played in a fierce and resilient style reflective of the Basque’s secessionist sentiments. The club Real Madrid played a powerful style befitting Castile’s geopolitical centrality and dominance. Yes, Spanish soccer is much more than a game, but, fortunately, it is also a game. I appreciated the spectral components of Spanish culture; art, literature and the American experience of it, as expressed by Hemingway. I imagined myself living there, challenging a bull and finding honor and ancient chivalry on any of thousands of Spanish soccer fields. The idea that I discussed with my teachers and family was to spend a semester abroad in Spain, which I did in my sophomore year.\n\nI arrived in the small town of Moralzarzal, near Madrid. My host family spoke Castilian Spanish, fast and at first hard to comprehend. I soon followed their children to the local school. It was a challenge, but I learned to love my host family, the local culture and way of life. I began to sing Spanish pop songs (and still do). I was able to join a local soccer club and play alongside of people for whom this sport was nothing less than the essence of life itself. My little town was fascinating; it’s shops, bullfighting arena and people.\n\nMy interest in Spain and its culture has not diminished with time. I stay in touch with my Spanish family, have hosted them at my home, and been involved with Spanish exchange students who visit us each year. In my neuroscience research, I learned that the foundation of my work was laid by the Spanish scientist Santiago Ramon y Cajal, who mapped out the structure of the nervous systems of many animals, from insect to human. Before Cajal, we did not know that the brain consists of intricate cells called neurons, or that neurons are connected by synapses. I saw many of Cajal’s beautifully artistic drawings of the nervous system on display at the museum of the Instituto Cajal in Madrid. In my work, I study how neurons register an animal’s hunger and translate it into the urge to hunt. These animals are designed to adapt their behavior to their experience. To quote Cajal, “Every man can, if he so desires, become the sculptor of his own brain”. I wish to sculpt my brain to understand the language and culture of Cajal, and to understand our brains through the study of neuroscience. I would like to continue my study of Spain and its cultures through courses offered by Harvard’s Department of Romance Languages and Cultures and continue my study of neuroscience at Harvard’s Center for Brain Science.",

      "essay": "“Always strive to do the hardest thing.” These words were spoken at our awards assembly a week after our high school’s mock trial team won the Idaho State Mock Trial Championship. The intensity of mock trial has been the turning point of my life so far.\n\nA mock trial competition is between two teams of eight students arguing a hypothetical court case. The teams present either the plaintiff or defense side in a trial held in an actual courtroom. The case consists of 70 pages of material, including six witness statements, exhibits, and rules of evidence. Students act as attorneys, who present opening and closing statements as well as direct and cross examinations, or as witnesses, who must portray their characters believably in the heat of a trial. I have competed as both an attorney and as a witness.\n\nThe preparation for the Idaho State Mock Trial Championship seems endless, lasting from November to March. It is an arduous cycle of writing and rewriting witness examinations, only to have them ripped apart at practice by my coaches. An exam consists of a series of questions that the attorney asks the witness. To conduct an examination, one must build a logical foundation of questions, upon which important facts from the witness’ statement can be pulled out and used as arguments. After several weeks of repeatedly honing our exams, our team crafts the arguments brd on the evidence. We develop a case theory and weave that through everything we present.\n\nBut this describes only the preparation. The trial itself is a whole different game. Attorneys must be able to articulate every subtle nuance of the case so that, in an objection fight, we can defend our witness and sway the jury. Attorneys sit on the edge of their plush swivel chairs, ready to object at any given moment before it’s too late. Our preparation enables us to respond well in unanticipated situations during the trial.\n\nI have also played a witness. I was both a German doctor (complete with an accent) who specialized in post-traumatic stress disorder and a DEA agent who was shot while on duty. I learned how to fully embody my character and create a three-dimensional persona that’s not only believable, but entertaining. We must scrutinize every aspect of our character and bring the words in our statement to life.\n\nBut again, that’s only the behind-the-scenes work.\n\nThe two-hour-long trial is where we are truly tested. Witnesses must know their characters so well that they can answer unanticipated questions during their cross examinations. We must remain calm and unflappable in the midst of an accusatory, and sometimes argumentative, cross.\n\nAfter four months and 130 hours of grueling preparation, the eight team members are so well-versed in mock trial jargon and so familiar with the case materials that we can anticipate problems and overcome them. Team work is a huge part. Directing attorneys must know their own witnesses and team members must be able to cover their teammates’ weaknesses. The attorneys fill their counsel table with notes on legal pads for the benefit of the other attorneys. During a round, no help from our coach is allowed. We are on our own.\n\nI’m now in my fourth year of mock trial. Twice, my team has won the Idaho championship and then competed in the national championship.\n\nThe tools I’ve learned through mock trial will benefit me for the rest of my life. I went into this ready to work hard, but I came out much more confident and experienced. The skills I picked up along the way are ingrained in me: diligence, persistence, and attentiveness. Because of mock trial, I always strive to do the hardest thing.\n\n",

This way, when I do meet up with you, we will hopefully be brd the awkward phase, and finally starting to become friends. I hope that everything has been going well for you prior to packing your bags and heading into the dorms. But I just wanted to take a moment to introduce myself, and let you know a few things about me.\n\nI am a fairly diverse individual. I like to have fun, and I like to learn. So it could be a toss up between me watching funny videos or reading my textbook until 3:00 a.m. on any given day. But I hope that doesn’t bother you, and I hope you are semi-active like me. On a nice day, with little to no class work to do, I would like to go outside and play ultimate frisbee, or take a walk down the park, or even just sit in the sun. So don’t be blind-sided when I come back from physics and I try dragging you outside in the fall.\n\nJust a heads-up before we meet…I am a bit weird. I have many diverse interests that seem to coincide within me. I like to watch YouTube videos, anime shows, cartoons, local news, historical documentaries, and science shows. But don’t worry about doing anything in a dirty room; I know how to take care of myself, and I will keep my share of the room clean. But besides that, I tend to make corny jokes that aren’t funny, and I don’t really participate in social media. That’s right: no Twitter, no Snapchat, no Instagram. So no, I won’t add you off of my phone: I am clearly too busy watching “Cosmos” to care.\n\nAnd lastly, I just want to say that I will be scared, but I will try not to admit it. I haven’t really spent a whole lot of time away from my family. Sure a day or two is one thing, but staying away for months at a time is a change I have to get used to. So that’s where I’ll need you to come in, to be supportive of this different time in my life. I care about my family dearly, and I may be missing them a lot, but they know how seriously I want to get a good education. So don’t worry if I shed a solitary tear every now and again. But hopefully you will come to trust me as your second family, as I will undoubtedly do the same.\n\nWith warm regards and best wishes,\n\n[Redacted]",

Now, the Pauli exclusion principle lays down the law quite firmly-“No two identical fermions can occupy the same quantum state simultaneously.” However, this presents some serious problems for our blooming room-lationship. I propose a new solution: the Hoatson Insert-Your-Last-Name-Here INclusion principle.\n\nOur principle quantum numbers should fall wherever we feel comfortable- if both of us need more time away from the room, we can have equal n’s. Our binding energies remain our own decisions.\nAzithumal quantum numbers are also ours to choose. If we both have similar interests and comfort zones, then of course our orbitals can take the same shape; if not, then that’s okay! Pauli can win this time.\n\nIII. Ah, the magnetic quantum number. An extra orbital is indeed acceptable, even for both of us simultaneously. Just please don’t kick me out to spend time with yours-I promise to follow the same rules!\n\nAnd finally, the spin magnetic number. As the best particle system on campus, we are absolutely allowed to be positive simultaneously. In fact, I wouldn’t have it any other way!

      "essay": "I have always regarded Joe as one of my musical heroes for working with world renown bands, such as [REDACTED], but he has influenced my life as a mentor, a role model, and a friend these past few years. I met Joe through my music school, the School of Rock, during my sophomore year when I joined the showteam, a team of the best musicians in the school that tour the state. He runs the band through rehearsals each week in preparation for our shows, however, when I first joined, he mentored me not only as a musician, but also through a crippling anxiety that stunted my playing and behavior. I was so nervous and anxious to meet him because I had been listening to his music for years, and I felt sort of starstruck to be learning from him. This anxiety made the first few rehearsals incredibly embarrassing as I constantly made mistakes and shied away from any interaction with the other band members. I was certain Joe would be disappointed or angry with me, however, he was incredibly kind and helped me get through my anxieties by talking to me in and out of rehearsal about the importance of having confidence in one’s self. He also taught me how to maintain a relaxed composure while on stage and during practice. His kindness helped me develop the confidence and composure needed to synergize with the band. Furthermore, his advice and mentoring molded me into the confident musician and person that I am today.\n\nHowever, Joe is also the reason why I’m a leader and teacher at the school today. After a year in showteam, Joe decided that the school needed a student to act as a mentor to all the younger students. I didn’t initially see myself as a possible candidate for the role so when he asked at showteam I immediately balked at the prospect. Joe, however, specifically asked me to fulfill this role as he was confident that I would be a great teacher and role model. At first, I was going to decline, but then remembered my earlier difficulties and how I had matured with Joe’s help. I wanted to help the younger children just as Joe had helped me. Further, the fact that he had so much faith in me empowered me and gave me the courage to accept. His proposal led to my work with the students and volunteering at the school’s summer camps, which, as I discussed in an earlier question, has led me to consider teaching as a career path. Joe’s confidence in me has helped me improve myself as a musician and as a person, and without him, I would never have realized my love of teaching children.",

      "essay": "Being colorblind isn’t all bad. In fact, as of late it has allowed me to see more than I otherwise would have.\n\nAs long as I can remember, I’ve loved airplanes. I’ve drawn them, read about them, built models of them, and watched them take off and land at the local airport. I can look up at a plane and identify it by shape, no color necessary! Naturally, ever since I learned that people make money playing with airplanes, I wanted to be a pilot.\n\nAs I got older though, I found that perhaps my colorblindness would prevent me from attaining my dream job. Last spring that I got myself formally tested. As it turned out, my red-green colorblindness was severe enough to keep me from flying commercially. Ever.\n\nI soon fell into that common trap of, “why me?” Why did I have to be colorblind? I never asked to be colorblind. None of my friends want to be pilots; why couldn’t one of them have been colorblind?\n\nUnfortunately, no amount of griping on my part would give me the ability to distinguish red and green; and so, as one might expect, there was a bit more inner searching to do: now what did I want to do with my life?   \n\nSoon though, it dawned on me that just because I couldn’t fly them didn’t mean I had to give up airplanes. I thought back to the many books I’d read and the models I’d built. It was then that I realized there were all kinds of things I’d love to do that still related to aviation. I could become a historian and share the rich history of aviation with others, and in doing so perhaps bring someone else into the magical world that is flight. I could become an aeronautical engineer and design the airplanes of the future, or a physicist to devise new ways to fly faster and further, or a chemist to find new materials that would make planes lighter and stronger. I could herald in a new age of fuel efficiency, speed, and safety.\n\nAs I read up on these subjects I discovered much in addition to airplanes that interested me. Bernoulli’s principle that explained the generation of lift was all good and well, but Einstein’s Theory of Relativity was simply mind-blowingly beautiful and impressively hard to get my head around. Antoine de Saint-Exupéry’s stories of his flying adventures were entertaining, but reading his more famous work The Little Prince in French was maddeningly brilliant in the doors it opened for my language skills.\n\nThere is so much out there I am eager to learn more about; and, if my colorblindness hadn’t ruled out flying, I may never have realized it. My inability to distinguish a few of the colors allowed me to discover a multitude of the exciting things I could do with my life besides fly. I still don’t know what I’ll do with my life, but that is due to a happy overabundance of options. My eyes are open to a world of engrossing and electrifying topics ranging from relativity to French-literature. While I still look up if I hear an airplane, now I see the world a little differently.",

      "essay": "Music has always been a dominant force in my life, inspiring and motivating me to challenge myself. With music, I could work towards mastering increasingly demanding passages while releasing my emotions through the melodies. For many years, the desire for acclamation drove me to practice and perform. I yearned for acknowledgement of my talent and the assurance that my playing was unparalleled; I wanted people to be astonished by my technical abilities and stylistic interpretations.\n\nEven when I played at volunteer concerts for seniors, my focus was on displaying my technical capability and receiving compliments after the performance. I chose difficult pieces with virtuosic passages and wide spectrums of dynamic expression. As the final chords resounded, I would lift my fingers from the keys with a flourish and then watch the reaction from the audience. The seniors always clapped politely, but I was left unfulfilled. I mused over how I could provoke more enthusiasm — perhaps I could add more glissandos or speed up the arpeggios.\n\nAfter one of our concerts, I was asked to play an additional piece as an encore for the seniors. I was thrilled at the request until I realized that I had already performed all the pieces that I prepared. Everyone was looking at me with anticipation, so I reached for the sheet music that was on top of the piano: Imagine by John Lennon. The notes seemed easy enough and I trusted my sight-reading ability. Taking a moment to skim through the pages, I delved into the famous introduction.\n\nWhen the verses came in, many of the seniors started to hum the melody. Some of them even began singing the tune while swaying with the piano chords. I was taken aback by the response and glanced distractedly at the audience until my fingers slipped on the keys. Turning my attention back to the piano, I poured my wonder into the progressions and the chorus. The room swelled with a medley of chords and voices that were slightly offbeat but somehow blended seamlessly with the music. Touched by the inspiration in the room, I joined my audience in singing the words of the timeless ballad.\n\nWhen the final notes of the song faded, the response was overwhelming, not in applause but in emotion. I watched as the seniors turned to each other, all smiles, forming connections and exchanging memories, and I could feel the warmth and happiness emanating from the crowd. In an instant, I realized that all my preconceptions about performing were wrong; I had been focusing too much on my ability and not on what actually mattered. I may have been the person at the piano, but the concert wasn’t about me at all. It was about the people listening — what they wanted to hear, what they enjoyed — not what I wanted to show them. It was a life-changing moment for me, a startling realization of what I had been missing. As I walked out of the senior home that day, I knew I had created more than a melody; I had created a memory.\n\n",

      "essay": "Projecting a glob of what I had once assumed was toothpaste into the bathroom sink,  I quickly realized mandarin was a bit more confusing than I had assumed. Glancing around the sink, suddenly, none of the characters seemed familiar. What was  the character for tooth? Was it ten strokes or eleven? And  why were there so many tubes in this bathroom?\n\nMy host dad’s voice drifts lazily from the kitchen “Do you need any help? “\n\nOh, he would. Trying to make me ask him. Forcing me to admit that I can’t differentiate the character for “Tooth” and “fungal” cream. So smug in his fluency.\nGrabbing a tube that looks promising, I slip out of the bathroom, and into my room. The pages of my chinese dictionary, previously crisp, are flattened, crumpled as I frantically flip to the character for “tooth”.\nMy host father begins to hum. I keep searching.\n\nIt’s useless, the character –牙or was it 壓 ? Is nowhere to be found. It is just me. A tube of what may or may not be fungal cream and my host Dad.\n\n“Ask him”  a small, treacherous, voice in my head pleads. “It’s your first night (in Taiwan), just ask him”\n\nGrudgingly, I pick up the tube and head towards the kitchen.\n\nWhen I  first started with languages, I struggled. Suddenly dependent upon others, I resisted. Questions became duels, between unsuspecting native speakers, and my blunt determination to not need them. When approached with a problem, I scoured every Chinese learning chat board, flipped frantically through every Spanish-English dictionary, and obsessed over the indexes of my chinese textbook looking for the answer. I stood alone, painfully aware that asking a native speaker a question felt more like admitting I was an inferior, than admitting I needed help.\n\nFor 18 years, I’ve held independence on a pedestal.  Self-sufficiency, more than anything, was to be constantly strived for. So, wary of anything that would depend me on others, I looked at questions with suspicion. They were crutches.  A symbol of not only being helpless, but acting helpless. Compliance with the dis-truth that we are  unable to find our own answers.\n\nSadly, languages  were unaware of my views on self-reliance. They demanded questions. No amount of concentration could help me name exotic fruit,  just as no amount of brow crinkling could correct my pronunciation. Instead, I was forced to seek out people. To need people. And so I’ve changed.\n\nIt was not immediate, the change. No moment of clarity. Instead, it was hard lost.\n\nI thought of questions as crutches and perhaps they are. But I’ve realized it is not the crutch that makes cripple, but the cripple who needs the crutch.  Languages in that sense we are all crippled. No man can be an island. We need people. It has been my struggle to embrace this.\n\nOn my last day in Taiwan, I sat at my dining room table, looking over my chinese textbook, waiting for my  host (little) brother to finish breakfast. Skimming the  pages, I notice a word I don’t remember. My dad’s whistling, floats slowly from the kitchen.\n\nI raise my voice. “Dad, Can I ask you a question?”\n\n",

      "essay": "Up until February 21, 2018, I was a Prince Charming on a quest to find the school that would fit perfectly into the glass slipper. After sitting in an information session, wandering down Locust Walk, and shadowing a current student, I knew that the University of Pennsylvania was my Cinderella. Penn’s commitment to interdisciplinary studies, the array of language classes offered, and its deep involvement within the West Philadelphia community fit perfectly with the type of education I hope to pursue. I plan to major in psychology in the School of Arts and Sciences, while minoring in American Sign Language.\n\n[Section removed for privacy reasons]\n\nAt the University of Pennsylvania, I hope to conduct research on the impact that a student’s at-home life can have on their academics, answering questions such as: How much of a role does trauma actually play in learning? Why is it that some children are more affected by adverse experiences than others? What can I do, as a Penn student, to help? Specifically, I hope to work alongside Professor Sara Jaffee on a study about our aligning interests, while also taking her class, Developmental Psychology: Social and Emotional Development. Her work is both admirable and inspirational. Due to Penn’s significant involvement within the Philadelphia community, I would have the opportunity to observe, analyze, and collect data on children with varied home lives and cultural backgrounds. By joining the Community School Student Partnership, I will be able to see, first-hand, the spectrum of student experiences. Additionally, I will be the mentor that the kids from my old city needed, guiding them in the right direction and providing them with opportunities they never imagined.\n\nWhile my main interest is in psychology, I look forward to diversifying my knowledge and discovering new interests with the sector requirements. Doing so would help me expand my horizons and ultimately become a well-equipped, well-rounded student. Specifically, I look forward to taking the Medicine in History course in the History and Tradition sector as well as the Introduction to Astrophysics course in the Physical World sector. While both are completely unrelated to my potential major, they are topics I’m eager to learn more about.\n\nOn my visit to the University of Pennsylvania, my tour guide, [name of tour guide], informed me of the opportunity to study American Sign Language. With the recent increase of deaf students in my high school, I have become captivated with the language, witnessing the power it has. Every week, my friend teaches me signs for different phrases, but that is not enough. I aspire to be fluent in the language and learn everything about it, from its origin, to it’s culture. Minoring in ASL and joining Penn-In-Hand would allow me to do so. With the field of psychology that I hope to pursue, communication is an essential skill, and a background in ASL would broaden the range of people with whom I can communicate.\n\nI look forward to living “happily ever after” with my Cinderella. Aside from its academics, the University of Pennsylvania will provide opportunities to make memories, including throwing toast at football games, participating in Hey day, and singing “The Red and the Blue.” Becoming a Quaker would be my fairy tale beginning.\n\n",

      "essay": "I’ve always loved words, but conventional was never among them. Growing up, I turned on the TV only for the Oscars and the Olympics, instead discovering the world through Lincoln Log cities and kitchen-sink science experiments. My education took advantage of nature, music, and hands-on exploration, dirt and noise my textbooks. It was an intense childhood, but one which encouraged independent thinking. To no one’s surprise, then, our family vacations took an equally atypical route: my parents matched budget with opportunity and rented RVs, family vacations on-the-go.\n\nOver the years, I have lived in ten RVs across eighteen states, two countries, and forty national parks. Far from the souped-up caravans which hunch haughtily over traffic, our functional campers featured oversized Mount Rushmore and 1-800-RV4RENT decals. The kitchen table turned into my bed; the National Park System became our driveway. I passed through more forests than John Muir himself, face pressed to the window. Meanwhile, our destination cities fascinated me in a different way, our 30-foot advertisement drawing stares outside art museums and cultural districts. What better way to discover creativity than San Francisco’s Mission District murals or the colorful spirit of Chihuly’s glass-blowing collaborative?\n\nThe RV itself was an equally creative space – small for six people – but its close quarters encouraged familial bonding and exploration far beyond its confines. The experience of fitting my entire life into one compartment felt transient but liberating, if just temporarily. At every destination I was first out the door, bursting onto scenery so vast and beautiful it humbled me in comparison. I felt invigorated to coexist with mountains, to scale a 12,000’ summit  but “conquer” only mental barriers. Often I stood still and observed, drinking in my surroundings, then continued onwards as unobtrusively as a shadow. Landscapes registered words in my head, an internal dialogue shaping stories to ease the ascent. My souvenir? The satisfaction of saying for years after, “I’ve climbed a mountain. This too I can overcome.”\n\nI prized the independence and autonomy these travels elicited. Yet I felt conflicted – much of the culture I witnessed throughout the country was anchored in community. Under the hot Colorado sun, it was the Mesa Verde cliff dwellings that remained resilient and remembered, not the lone ranger of the day. Similarly, Colonial Williamsburg was preserved to commemorate our nation’s first experiment in communal governance. Truly, while I romanticized the open road and starting anew, I discovered that persevering cultures survived through community. Each member’s responsibility utilized his or her skillset for a clear and collective purpose, just as I must do today as an ensemble actor.\n\nUltimately, while I am drawn to unconventionality and exploration, I find tradition and community continue to ground me. I am the product of every trail I’ve hiked, every battleground which compelled me, every unlikely tale I’ve heard en route. And every campground, where the RVs of a hundred fellow travelers briefly shared protection and warmth like a wagon train under a new and unknown sky.\n\n",

      "essay": "I was born an introvert. From the moment I learned to walk, I sought out the most obscure hiding spots in the house to read and draw in seclusion until my parents dragged me out. When I began public schooling, I sat quietly and obediently in the corner, sneaking peeks at my books while my classmates prattled away with each other. Unsolicited conversation was my greatest fear, and moments alone were my greatest treasure.\n\nEveryone thought I was too independent, shy, and socially inept. But I was happy to be an introvert. Being quiet allowed me to meditate on my thoughts, to reflect on the world around me and make insights into life and people. Thoughtfulness and intellectualism, to me, were fine replacements for social agility. So I kept silent even when I felt pressured to interact with other kids, seeking solitude from my first day of kindergarten to my early adolescence.\n\nBut there were rare moments when I would open up, where anyone would least expect it: in front of an audience.\n\nI was shaken with nerves when engaging in casual conversations, always fretting about the impression my word choices, my tone, even my subtlest facial expressions would give. But when I got in front of a room of dozens of people, my anxiety transformed instead into empowerment. It was the only environment in which I was willing – eager, even – to speak. I had the freedom to take discourse in whatever direction I wanted to explore. I could talk about the meaningful ideas that didn’t quite fit in the superficial conversations of young teenagers, but which I very desperately wanted to discuss. I could command the respect of my classmates, with whom I struggled to connect with individually. Being on stage or in front of the classroom, I could put up the best version of me: the strong, intellectual, and confident self that I hoped to become as I got older.\n\nI’ve opened up since my bashful years in middle school, finally learning that I can be myself in the company of others and have worthwhile conversations that widen my worldview just as greatly as do my introspective revelations. But my love for public speaking has only grown stronger, expanding beyond generic classroom projects to research presentations and school board meetings. And every weekend, I deliver speeches in rooms full of teenagers dressed in suits (by far the most intimidating audience). These debate tournaments require intense individual research and preparation, but the result is exceptionally collaborative. In those cramped classrooms scattered with paper placards and wrinkled legal pads, intellectual synergy of the highest degree takes place. My ideas are no longer internal, alone, and passive. They join with dozens of others in an orchestra of debate, transformed from idle thoughts and musings into forces for change. That’s the greatest thing about speaking – realizing the potential of immaterial thinking. There is nothing more exciting than becoming a contributor to innovation, and offering one more mind to a world of ideas.\n\n",

      "essay": "How can the post-apocalyptic, Simpsons-obsessed world of Anne Washburn’s Mr. Burns be appropriately expressed in a theater that seats a hundred? How can the set of J.M. Barrie’s The Admirable Crichton effectively and efficiently transform from the stuffy, rigid interior of Loam House, Mayfair, to a deserted tropical island in the Pacific? How can Shakespeare’s As You Like It be elevated by a setting that both evokes the play’s Globe beginnings and reflects the modern relevance of the work?\n\nA lot of people grow up with dreams of being an actor. I am not among them. Even so, my love for theater is well documented in my closet. Embedded in the piles of childhood relics of questionable value are countless programs and stubs from shows I remember seeing, and a variety of elaborate props and set pieces from shows my brother and I used to put on.\n\nIt’s clear looking back that we were far more concerned with the visual and technical aspects of the productions than we were with the quality of our acting skills. “Top Secret” notebooks are littered with sketches of set pieces and elaborate mechanisms for special effects and lighting: a makeshift astronomical backdrop projector and an unnecessarily complicated shadow projection screen, to name a few. They’re strikingly similar to my notebooks today — sketches and doodles in the margins, all trying to tackle the same question: how do you tell the story you want to tell?\n\nIt’s an issue I think about a lot in the theatrical design work that I do. Each production is less like an image, and more like a puzzle — acting, lights, sets, props, and costumes have to work together smoothly to tell a cohesive and captivating story. Each piece cannot suitably stand on its own in the way that a painting or a sculpture can. The challenge of creating the compelling, coordinated world of a play is one that I’ve loved grappling with and have been fascinated by since I was young. I’ve always enjoyed reading plays, in part because the mental process of constructing the associated visuals is so appealing to me.\n\nWhen people go to see a play, they don’t do so to see the set — they go to see the actors, and they go to see the story itself. But what makes theater great isn’t just the story or the actors: it’s the complete and total immersion and engagement that can only happen when everything comes together. A great set doesn’t overpower, but it is far from “just the backdrop”. A great set enhances a play by highlighting underlying emotional qualities and contrasts of a work, creating visual interest, and helping to transport the audience into the world of the play. And that excites me.\n\n",

That channeling my passion for logic can enable me to forge pathways towards change and help people and communities I care about is what allures me to this field.\n\nThe way I see it, the future of the world will be written in code. From photometric analysis of asteroid images to recursive programs for matrix multiplication to time-converters for ephemeris-planning: the sheer versatility of computer science, as I experienced at YSPA, inspires me. Moreover, that CS embodies evolution inspires me: in a world of constantly-evolving languages and persistently-innovative technologies, the learning never stops. From online courses on machine-learning to comprehending the intrinsic process of analysing a domain and defining its semantic model and linguistic abstractions when developing a Domain-Specific Language on Trigonometric Proofs-CS has taught me to work independently, and (ironically so) taught me the art of autodidactism.\n\nFrom partaking in a global collegiate competition to pitch an app to democratise the world’s largest democracy to winning a state-level competition for kiosk-content development: what inspires me most is that from mathematics to politics to education to medicine to astrophysics, my passion for CS harmonises with every one of my interests: conducting my discordant brain of disparate fascinations into a mellifluous symphony. From furthering this goal by using machine learning for everything from fiscal-policy decision making to algorithmic composition to spending caffeine-induced all-nighters at RoAR debugging a robot to restore functional movements to Parkinson’s patients; from engineering for humanity with EWB to creating a startup as path-breaking as nagish during DevFest: I look forward to being inspired, invigorated, and ignited by SEAS.\n\n",

      "essay": "As a child the world fascinated me. From questioning the makeup of the dirt I played in, to doubting the existence of gravity as I flew a kite, I was always thinking. Time passed, and my consciousness opened to more, like atoms, the Big Bang Theory, the psychology behind dreams, and the list goes on. Everything fascinated me; curiosity quickly became a part of my character. Some say ignorance is bliss, but I have to disagree. Ignorance is what fuels my curiosity; ignorance is what drives me to discover, learn, and initiate change. Living in a small rural town with my grandmother and disabled father, I have been limited by geography and socioeconomics. A perfect blend of humanities and factualities, the College of Arts and Sciences is an exploratory lab for all I do not know. At Penn, courses from Neurobiology of Learning and Memory to The Sociology of Gender allow me to rid my ignorance one class at a time. The unique and specialized curriculum provides a place to explore whatever I wonder and answer whatever I question. While my grandmother did not have the money for me to attend science camps, to visit museums, or to travel more than a few hours from my home, living in the country always provided me with endless exploration. My interest in trees in particular led me to specialize in the forestry portion of our Envirothon team for four years of high school. The passion I have for biology is second to my interest in helping others. Rural areas of Pennsylvania are in desperate need for physicians, especially in the field of women’s health. My goal is to return to my community and fill that need. As a low income, first-generation student, I have had limited opportunities, but I have seized any that I could and where there were none, I created some. As a seventh grader, I pioneered the colorguard of our newly formed high school marching band. Last year, as captain of 14 twirlers, I took my first plane ride to Disney World where my band performed. This experience taught more than I could ever learn in a classroom. Similarly, there are endless opportunities at Penn, both intra- and extra-curricular, and I plan to take advantage of all that I can to feed my fire.",

      "essay": "Last summer I participated in molecular biology research at Boston University. Surrounded by 39 other high school seniors, I perceived with new clarity how an inquisitive, curious mind must interact in an unapologetic manner. Entering lectures about the basics of molecular biology, most of us initially thought we knew a great deal about biology. I quickly realized my naivete, and once I accepted my own ignorance, I settled into a passive absorption mode. The looks on all our faces told the same story. Well, all of ours except Kelsey’s.\n\nBrilliant and inquisitive, Kelsey exhibited no fear raising her hand and boldly asking questions. Even during the portions of the lectures when we were simply reviewing concepts of biology, she never ceased to question the current topic. The first few times she asked questions, I thought she had little background knowledge so she just needed clarification. Yet as the first week progressed, I realized that not only did she have the background information required for this course but also the grit and determination needed for success in research. The levels of her questions stumped our lecturer at times and he responded, “I’ll have to get back to you on that one.”\n\nOften I just wanted to yell, “PUT YOUR HAND DOWN!!!”, as my tolerance for her constant inquiry began to erode while sitting through her questions and their subsequent answers. Due to her deep and thought-provoking questions, she became the class pariah; not necessarily because she was annoying but because of her resolute and indefatigable inquisitiveness. She was insatiable in her pursuit of knowledge, like a ribosome clinging to the endoplasmic reticulum.\n\nYet as the course progressed, I finally began to notice the value of Kelsey’s questions. She asked questions of importance, questions researchers must ask themselves every day. Her inquiries were thoughts no one else my age seemed to have. The depth and breadth of her ideas fascinated me, especially given that she was only sixteen.\n\nKelsey’s questions made me realize the importance of questioning preconceived notions.\n\nSubsequently, I became aware of my own willingness to challenge concepts that were accepted and taught as seemingly concrete, and I recognized the danger of blindly absorbing information without disputing it. Seeing the scholarly nature of Kelsey’s intellectual curiosity, I began to emulate her queries during the final few weeks of the program. Not only did I get more out of the lectures, but I also gained the experience necessary to question ideas and facts and search for answers, a vital skill in every academic realm.\n\nAs a student with an interest in the sciences, I ask questions that may not have an obvious answer. As someone who strives for knowledge, I am willing to do research if what I am asking has no answer, but I do not simply possess an affinity toward knowledge. I wish to create it. Most young people cite coaches, teachers, or other adults as influential; however, for me, a peer-modeled approach to learning also has merit.\n\n",

In elementary and middle school, I enjoyed serving the community through Isaiah’s Room, my church’s ministry to the needy, even if it meant I’d have to simply slice bread. Today, I continue to serve in that ministry, but in a greater capacity. Working to provide more opportunities for the underserved has allowed my passion for service to bloom.\n\nThis year, I was able to organize laundry services for our less fortunate friends.

Our community homeless shelter is unable to provide enough laundry services to supply the great demand of our homeless population. I’ve recognized how direct engagement with communities, along with research, is essential to meeting their needs. Although Isaiah’s Room provides some necessities, I’ve come to realize that these are really Band-Aid fixes. Meals, clothing, and laundry services will certainly help our friends in need, but they won’t transform their lives entirely. I want to put an end to societal issues, straight from their roots, beginning with public policy. Fostering change through service, as my church does, is truly impactful. However, pairing service with eradicating issues, such as systemic poverty through policy reform, is even more powerful.\n\nAs organizations, like religious institutions, continue to play a vital role in helping the indigent with practical services, I need the analytical wherewithal to address the effectiveness of public policy and help make a collaborative difference in the lives of those in need. This is precisely what the Policy Analysis and Management (PAM) major in the College of Human Ecology aims to achieve. The interdisciplinary strategy of Cornell’s PAM major, inclusive of economics, sociology, demography, political science and public health, is exactly the type of education I need and desire at this juncture.\n\nThroughout my college search, I believed majoring in business was the route I should take for the next four years. I was laser focused on applying to business schools because of my desire to work in nonprofit management until I looked deeply at Cornell. When I discovered Cornell’s PAM major and Inequality Studies minor, I knew I had found a very personal fit. I’m excited about the opportunity to take courses such as Race and Public Policy, Economic Analysis of the Welfare State, Families and Social Inequality, as well as attend symposiums and experience the variety of speakers through the Center for the Study of Inequality.\n\nI can see the negative impact public policy has historically had on my segregated city of New Rochelle. It’s reflected in AP and Honors classes at our single high school, where African American students are underrepresented more drastically than any other minority. As well, the layout of neighborhoods in my city fosters segregation. The wealthy, white, and Jewish families live on the north side of the city while mostly middle and lower class African American, Latino, and Asian families live on the south end.

They’re deeply invested in analyzing programs and methods of delivering services that work best. I’m intrigued by their relentless pursuit of the qualitative and quantitative research necessary to make informed funding decisions. I’ve already been offered an internship this coming summer to learn beside their Chief Operating Officer that I, wholeheartedly, plan to accept. As a future nonprofit head, it’s my plan to develop the capacity to evaluate both the public policy and community organizations that can make the greatest difference in the lives of people who are stuck at the margins of society.\n\n",

      "essay": "Am I a hostage to my illusion of freedom?\n\nThe image of prisoners oblivious to the origins of shadows on a wall in front of them in Plato’s “Allegory of the Cave” flashes on the pages of Kant’s “Doctrine of Right” as I become lost in Immanuel Kant’s insight on the fundamental nature of free will. I challenge my conception of America as a beacon of freedom through debates brought on by political philosophers.\n\nI first came to understand the nuances of our laws through the Santa Clara County Peer Court, in which I spoke against and on behalf of defendants. I began to ask of myself questions that the law attempts to address. Who determines right and wrong? What does it mean to be just?\n\nA lifelong poetry and prose enthusiast, I began to see the commonalities between creativity and philosophy as I came across a wonderful variety of perspectives on life and began to question my preconceived notions. I considered these dilemmas as a leader in my club Intersections and explored controversy from an unbiased viewpoint as a writer for The Epic. As an intern with Stanford researcher Dr. Jen King, I examined privacy laws and wondered what ancient philosophers would say about them. Following these experiences, I pursued coursework in philosophy and justice and came to understand the beauty of the law and the societies it governs.\n\nI know that my unquenchable thirst for exploring the role of the humanities in the world will flourish at the College of Arts and Sciences with its emphasis on the exploration of society’s heritage and potential for innovation through a stimulating education.\n\nAs a prospective Philosophy major at the Sage School, I will push my intellectual and creative boundaries by taking advantage of small classes in a nurturing collegiate atmosphere. Once home to professor John Rawls, whose work I have read voraciously, the Sage School would be the ideal environment for my participation in a vibrant exchange of ideas through the Minorities in Philosophy Reading Group, Norman Kretzmann Undergraduate Philosophy Lecture, and unique classes like “Ethics of Eating” and “Minds and Machines.” I will expand on my learning by writing for The Philosophical Review, in which I would investigate pertinent moral debates such as the controversy surrounding Google’s Project Nightingale, a Google venture harvesting the medical data of patients across the United States. Coupled with my studies in philosophy, I plan to pursue a minor in Law and Society to push myself to further probe and someday improve the policies and ethical institutions behind our government.\n\nI aspire to conduct research alongside mentors like Professor David Shoemaker, whose ethical ideas surrounding interpersonal relationships and his psychological analysis of people’s responsibility for their actions, as discussed in his book Responsibility from the Margins, pique my interest. I look forward to discussing Professor Shoemaker’s thoughts on concepts like adapting our laws to better handle the criminal responsibility imposed upon the mentally ill and the extent of Big Tech companies’ obligations to society.\n\nAs a global citizen, I envision putting my passport to good use through the Cornell Global Program at EDUCO in Paris; its significance as a visionary hub of culture, political thought, and social activism would allow me to pursue my interest in the French language while furthering my education in a global context.\n\nOutside of the classroom, I will foster my passion for creative writing by lending my voice to discourse in the Literary Society, perhaps using the astounding nature surrounding Cornell’s campus as inspiration for my pieces. I also excitedly anticipate the opportunity to continue to advocate for social justice and equality by addressing such issues as opportunity gaps in education through the Alternative Breaks service program.\n\nAs a student at the College of Arts and Sciences, I will employ my interdisciplinary education and extracurricular opportunities to contribute to the community in Ithaca and across the globe.\n\n",

      "essay": "Food has always been central to my life. Given my long-standing interest in culinary arts and nutrition, I spent many years during my youth developing and perfecting a range of my own healthy recipes. It wasn’t until I started working at the Rogers Cup, however, that I came to appreciate the business and hospitality aspect of the food and beverage industry.\n\nIt was my first day on the job. Positioned behind the cash register at the buffet entrance, I was in the middle of the lunch rush when I reached into the till to grab change–and realized I had run out. Furiously messaging for backup, I quickly decided to proceed with my regular smile, chatting with customers and accepting cash, while promising to return their change as soon as possible. An hour later, I left my shift having successfully identified and reimbursed each customer I owed. I had genuinely enjoyed their satisfied smiles which—for the first time—opened my eyes to the challenges and rewards of the hospitality industry. I returned to work at Rogers Cup for three more summers thereafter, where unexpected challenges and many more customer interactions furthered my customer service skills and my understanding of its importance to business success.\n\nWanting to learn more, I strove to gain more experience in the hospitality industry. In high school, I focused my DECA studies on food marketing, became the VP of Marketing at my youth startup, and most recently, interned as Marketing Assistant at Tennis Canada. Combining my inner foodie with my passion for business, I now aspire to become a restaurateur and launch a chain of healthy cafes, with home-baked pastries, locally-sourced salad bars, and freshly ground coffee. My marketing experience will help me attract my first customers; my pastry recipes and excellent customer service will turn them into repeat visitors.\n\nAt Cornell Summer College this year, I became convinced that there is no better place for me to pursue hospitality and realize my entrepreneurial dream than at SHA. Academically, I thrive by learning while doing and am particularly excited for the Restaurant Management course and Establishment, where I can develop a menu for a true sit-down restaurant. I hope to benefit from its on-the-job-training, especially personnel training and management, which will add significant depth and clarity to my understanding of how to successfully run a restaurant. Additionally, I’m interested in building a career with an international focus, which makes SHA a perfect fit. I look forward to participating in the school’s diverse study abroad opportunities, particularly in France, where I can use my conversational French and culinary interests to gain insight into French culture and the global food and beverage industry–and learn to bake authentic éclairs. Finally, I value the importance of learning from others and believe that a tight-knit community with shared interests will best facilitate my learning. SHA represents for me an unparalleled opportunity to join the ranks of inspiring, supportive, and outgoing hotel students, and I look forward to contributing to the inclusive and dynamic community. I can envision myself innovating with Hotelie Entrepreneurs Club, experimenting with the Chocolate and Confections Technology Club, and flying with the Quidditch Club.\n\nThis summer, I met my best friend from Ukraine for delectable omelets at the RPCC, walked through the mist of Ithaca falls for TA discussions, and attended Professor David Taylor’s engaging lectures. It quickly became a routine I wished to never bid goodbye. Gazing at the SHA building on the last day of Summer College, I imagined life as a Hotelie, about to attend her favorite professor’s lecture on consumer psychology or start another day of work at the Statler Hotel. My life’s next journey feels just around the corner, and I know it will be Cornell that lights my path to the revolutionary healthy cafe chain of my dreams.\n\n",

      "essay": "I was thirteen sitting in my eighth grade geometry class, when I first heard of Fermat’s Last Theorem. We were discussing Pythagorean triples, whole number solutions to the Pythagorean Theorem, and conversation arose about the possibility of solving for exponents larger than two. What about three, four, or five? Eventually, this led to the teacher saying, “This is called Fermat’s Last Theorem. You won’t learn about it until you are much older.” With a dismissal like that, I naturally spent the whole night researching it instead of reading A Separate Peace for English. My fascination for this theorem was two-fold. The theorem is a seemingly simple concept, while on the other hand, it is notorious for being one of the most difficult proofs in all of mathematics. Fermat, himself, claimed he knew how to prove it, but promptly died leaving no evidence to back up his assertion. For over three and a half centuries, mathematicians were stumped by a seemingly impossible problem. Until it wasn’t.\n\nFermat’s Last Theorem was the impossible math proof, but overtime, collective mathematical knowledge grew. In 1993, British mathematician Andrew Wiles combined others’ theorems and conjectures to show that Fermat’s Last Theorem was a special case of semi-elliptical curves and that the theorem was a modular form. As a result, Fermat’s Last Theorem was proven to be correct. Consequently, once the mathematical community reviewed Wiles’ proof, it was widely agreed that Fermat could not have proven the theorem, because the general mathematical understanding in 1637 was not developed enough yet. Though the story of its eventual solution is exhilarating, to me, this episode underscores a more important lesson that is as true in science and engineering as it is in mathematics: it is not through individual genius, but collective effort and exploration that impossible problems become solvable.\n\nImpossibilities surround us in the world. Here’s my impossibility—developing a solution to the global management of heart disease. Every year, millions die of cardiovascular complications, but nobody has a large-scale solution. My father’s death opened my eyes to the limited treatment options for cardiovascular disease, in that medicine can diagnose the disease, but current preventative measures are inefficient, as it is still the leading cause of death in America. Like Fermat’s Last Theorem, however, this problem does not have to remain unsolvable. Biomedical engineering applications enable us to foresee biological and physiological phenomena, and conceive system-oriented solutions to problems that have previously been treated symptomatically. I aspire to find new ways to track the growth of arterial plaque and blood clots throughout the body to better maintain blood flow, reducing, maybe someday eliminating, heart attacks, cardiac arrests, and strokes.\n\nI see Cornell as my next step towards accomplishing this aspiration. My brother, Matt, went to Cornell Engineering for his B.S. ([Date]) and M.S. ([Date]), and his accomplishments are what initially drew me to the College of Engineering. He was a member of the DARPA Robotics team that built an autonomous vehicle. Cornell’s theoretical approach to systems allowed him to find new ways of visualizing the world when solving problems. Although my brother and I have differing interests, I see through him how a Cornell education fosters a mindset not just to improve the status quo, but to reimagine it.\n\nCornell researchers are already pioneering the future of cardiovascular engineering, where professors and students are researching “heart-assist technology” to discover better solutions to pediatric heart problems. That project is already seeking answers to many of the questions that motivate me, and I’m excited about the prospect of joining the effort. The college’s theoretical approach combined with its project teams offers a way for students like me to not just learn how to build things, but to understand the conceptual principles underlying each problem. With this two-pronged method, Cornell Engineering will allow me to solve my personal Fermat’s Last Theorem of developing better methods to combat heart disease.\n\n",

      "essay": "Studying computer science gives me the opportunity to be in a field that evolves so quickly I can always be on the forefront and do cutting-edge work. This summer at an ad-tech company, I moved the data science team’s analysis programs to a novel cluster-computing engine (Kubernetes), which can manage and distribute tasks across thousands of computers at once. Kubernetes is so new that barely any information has circulated about it. Because of this novelty, I was able to publish the first existing documentation of a data science pipeline in Kubernetes.\n\nComputer science can also automate the manual drudgery of life. For example: to manage my clubs, I’ve written a program that checks for emails from members with excuses for missing meetings and automatically logs their absences.\n\nSince computers have become the platform for every science, coding allows me to contribute to numerous fields. When I started at Einstein College of Medicine last year, I knew nothing about computational biology. Our project showed me that basic programming was all I needed to find fascinating results in the mostly unstudied mountains of genomic data.\n\nAs a person, I’m drawn to seemingly impossible challenges, in particular, the quest to teach machines and create mechanical consciousness. When I started taking online courses in AI, I became fascinated by the gradient descent method in machine learning. The method casts complex input data (e.g. photos) as thousand-dimensional surfaces and attempts to descend to the lowest points (minima) of those surfaces. It works best on data with underlying patterns, like pictures of human faces. This indicates that, in some way, the very nature of what a ‘face’ is, what unique structure is shared by nearly all faces, is found in the minima that AI models descend towards. My dream is to do foundational artificial intelligence research.\n\n",

      "essay": "When I first started seriously thinking about college during sophomore year, I didn’t want to go anywhere outside of Ohio. I thought I would be too far away from home. But the more mail I received from different colleges, the more I realized that some of my best opportunities were going to come from outside of my comfort zone, from outside of Ohio. One pamphlet from the University of Pennsylvania in particular caught my eye, and although I was a bit skeptical at first, as I did my research I realized that the University of Pennsylvania is a top tier university that holds many unique opportunities for its students.\n\nOne of the first things I noticed when I began to research Penn was their emphasis on interdisciplinary studies. This appealed to me because I have never been interested in only one subject. The fact that a third of my classes would be taken outside of the Wharton School tells me that I will be able to explore a variety of classes in virtually any subject. For example, although I do not want to major in it, I have always been interested in computer coding. Hopefully I will able able to take some introductory level computer programming or coding classes at Penn even though it is not directly related to finance, my potential concentration. I am also excited about the availability of foreign languages at the University of Pennsylvania. I started learning French in eighth grade, and since my school only offers four years of French, I wasn’t able to take it my senior year, and I really miss it. I also started learning Portuguese during high school because I want to travel to Brazil one day. I want to continue learning both of these languages at the University of Pennsylvania. I am very excited about the opportunities that the emphasis on interdisciplinary studies will give me at Penn.\n\nAnother aspect of Penn that I found fascinating was their different programs regarding political science. At one point, I wanted to major in political science. But when I took an Introduction to Global Politics class at the Ohio State University during the summer before my senior year, I didn’t know if I could honestly see myself studying that for four years. However, during my time researching political science at Penn, I found out about an amazing program that I could participate in: Penn in Washington. Political science is currently my second choice major, and if I decide that’s what I want to major in, it would be with a concentration in American Politics, so the Penn in Washington program would be perfect for me to find an internship and learn about how the different parts of government work together in the heart of America’s government. However, if I choose not to major in political science, I would still be interested in the American Public Policy minor, which is offered through the political science department in the College of Arts and Sciences and the Wharton School, which is where I will possibly be pursuing a degree in finance. Penn seems to match perfectly with what I want to study in college. I am really excited for the opportunities that the University of Pennsylvania will give me. From the interdisciplinary studies to the foreign languages and political science programs, I will have plenty of chances to explore my diverse interests here at the University of Pennsylvania.",

My interest in research gained from that summer translated to last summer when I participated in Boston University’s Research in Science and Engineering program as a part of the intensive molecular biology practicum. I conducted scientific research with a group of my peers and learned many facets of university laboratory work.

      "essay": "Since seventh grade, I’ve been obsessed with making others smile. That year was tough on my 12-year-old, bewildered self. It was the first time I’d struggled through anything major in my life. Someone important in my life passed away. Several relationships were beaten up and broken down. My once-straight-A grades took a turn for the worse as the magnet school experience bore down upon me. And ever since I was forced to be that one kid who cried through lunch with her head down on the table, I decided to make sure nobody else would have to be that kid.\n\nI’ve tried everything to hear someone’s laugh, from biting sarcasm to the pain of a bad pun. But when I think about when my friends and I are laughing the most, it’s all together, in a call at midnight. We’re playing computer games and listening to silly music and laughing at the expense of each other as we die at the hands of the enemy team in the most ridiculous ways.\n\nI started playing League of Legends late last year. It was a way for me to feel strong and unstoppable when I felt powerless in reality. The gameplay was what initially hooked me, but everything else about the game was equally, if not more, fascinating. The design of the maps, champions, and skins. The precise animations and detail in every interaction. The engrossing theme songs and background music, especially ones like Aurelion Sol’s intro (highly recommend, by the way; it’s a beautifully written, insistent orchestral piece). The concept of worldbuilding and forever expanding upon the backstories of over a hundred characters and their universe. The way gaming brings all sorts of people together and lets them really laugh.\n\nI once read a throwback article, called “Total Recall, or: That Time We Disabled Ranked,” that was written by product managers, designers, and producers. It covered an intensive bug that forced the company to work nearly 28 hours straight in order to restore the game and discussed the processes behind bugfixing. It was this article that truly incensed my interest in game design.\n\nWhen reading about the majors and programs that Cornell provides, I felt a rare yet very real spark of excitement for college and my future. I’d heard of the notoriety of the Computer Science major at Cornell, but the option to follow the major within the School of Arts and Sciences eased my mind. As a right-brained student, I’ve always felt the struggle to succeed academically, especially within maths and sciences, while still pursuing my artistic interests. The BA CS major gives the ability to major in what I want to do while also getting exposure to a larger breadth of courses in other schools. I believe that Cornell will be able to reconcile my passions and style of learning by providing an environment in which I can thrive.\n\nBut what caught my eye the most was the specific game design minor that I could pursue alongside a major in computer science. It seems pretty unique to the school and is exactly what I’ve been wanting from a prospective school. Through this route, I’d be able to further my current understanding of programming and learn how to apply this to the world of design and animation. I’d be worlds closer to not only bringing my ideas to life, but also bringing the same happiness, excitement, and immersion that I feel to other gamers like me.\n\nGaming is what brings a smile to my face, as it does to millions of other people around the globe. I want my efforts to inspire happiness and infectious laughter to reach the world by doing what I love. And now, it truly feels as though Cornell has given me a real chance at being able to make someone smile by doing what they love.",

I intend to supplement my language acquisition with practical application through study abroad opportunities at PUC-Rio, Brazil and in Santiago, Chile, perhaps through the Engaged Scholars Program which will allow me to forge deeper connections with the communities and cultures I am studying. I am also attracted by the possibility of a 5-year BA/MA course in Linguistics which will permit me to conduct meaningful and extensive research on a topic I am truly passionate about.\n\nHowever, I also have an interest in Biochemistry and Molecular biology. The Open Curriculum will enable me to pursue this avenue of study and research without detracting from my principal focus on languages. Therefore, perhaps what I am most excited for is interdisciplinary study at Brown and the possibility of forging unforeseen connections between disparate academic areas and weaving them together into a program of study that will engage, thrill, and inspire me towards a lifelong path of academic inquiry.

Developing a passion fundamentally requires me, as Murray puts it, “to be my own channel.” Problem solving, understanding difficult concepts, having intense discussions all demand your mind to be present and I am more than happy to oblige.\n\nIntellectual vitality is not my application buzzword, it is my lifestyle.",

Our kitchen moonlighted as a laboratory, complete with burets.

My house was a sanctuary, a place where no question was too small, no claim uninvestigated.\n\nIt is precisely this background that drew me to research. Spending the past two summers in a neuroscience clinic, I found my second home surrounded by quirky med students, exhausted post-docs, and incisive surgeons. I felt more comfortable than I ever had in high school; loving science was no longer an embarrassment, but an asset. Lunch was spent in discussion about anticipatory alpha activity, and that’s just how I liked it. Though we used EEG’s in place of homemade indicators, MATLAB instead of “borrowed” dry ice, we were working towards the fundamental goal I’d spent my childhood developing: finding new knowledge.\n\nEvery one of my dreams can be traced back to my past, to individuals and experiences that have shaped the way I see the world and how I hope to better it.

      "essay": "I was born amidst the jubilant chords of Beethoven’s Seventh Symphony,  two hundred and fifty measures after my twin brother. I once asked why, of all the music ever written, my mother chose this piece to welcome us into the world. Her answer was simple:  she wanted the first thing we heard to be utterly joyous.\n\nBlame it on Beethoven, but the right side of my brain quickly established dominance.  At three, I raced my brother to name the instruments in Peter and the Wolf. Soon after, I sat enthralled as Tony furtively serenaded Maria in a touring production of West Side Story. Even while exploring my family’s ancestry in Warsaw, it was the lively street music and costumes which captured my attention.  After learning musical theater had its own genre, I quickly resolved to become part of the music, dance, and acting which so mesmerized me. By that summer’s end, I had taken my first closing bow.\n\nTo think I would one day find my own role in musical theater in Hartford, Connecticut, a city with America’s third highest poverty rate, seemed improbable. Yet, within this city, I discovered an oasis of ingenuity. The Greater Hartford Academy of the Arts which I attend is a magnet school established to offer the state’s most passionate high school artists unparalleled training. In a city as poor as this, my classmates and I have grown rich with opportunities to live and breathe art, constantly exposed to different rhythms, voices, and cultures. Although 50% of the Academy’s students hail from the inner city, 100% receive equal artistic training.\n\nIn the partially-converted Colt gun factory, now better known as the Academy, assembly lines have transformed into dance studios. Today art defines this space – my space – supplanting the revolver as the best weapon of self-preservation. We drop our defenses in this integrated environment which fosters the natural creativity and open-mindedness society needs to make progress. Here I am inspired to catalyze change, because the challenging themes we tackle demand both introspection and interaction to determine solutions. With art as the equalizer, I no longer hesitate to expose my vulnerabilities onstage; I have grown comfortable performing before my talented peers and value their critique. My classmates and I truly are – to borrow a theatre term – an ensemble.\n\nAs a student, I lead a “double life,” pulled between public high-school academics in the morning and inner-city arts classes in the afternoon, their only connector a long bus commute. My fourteen-hour school day has trained me in different arts – those of discipline and time management. Often, maintaining balance meant studying biology flashcards in the theater wings, listening for my cues while committing mitosis to memory.\n\nYet, admittedly, I would be torn without musical theatre, as if missing part of myself. I have discovered my own offstage identity by portraying roles different than myself, both emulating the traits I admire in my characters and learning from their faults. This “work” is my passion; exploring Sondheim’s repertoire, rehearsing intricate tap patterns, and annotating scripts are more guilty pleasures than assignments. I now have outlets for the scenes and musical phrases which accent my thoughts thanks to teachers who inspire and motivate a high standard of achievement.\n\nAnd while I love the bright stage lights and costumes, the true power of art lies in its connection with individuals, not just a packed audience. I have witnessed the humanity of performance firsthand as a member of Arts from the Heart, a self-directed group of high schoolers who perform for those without access to theater. I sense that my own comfort within musical theater puts others at ease, from residents of convalescent homes and long-term hospital units to caretakers seeking respite from draining days. These stripped-down, humble performances remind me why art is created, and why I pursue it: to inspire hope and a change in perspective – and often, a smile.\n\n",

      "essay": "Bluntly put, moving in high school was difficult. I remember waving good-bye to my best friend through tear-filled eyes. I remember staying up the night before the first day at my new school, dreading having to eat lunch alone. I remember crying on my birthday. Most of all, I remember hating how my life had become a movie cliche, how I had seemingly been reduced to a shell of myself by relocating 399.2 miles south.\n\nResolute in my desire to restore some semblance of normalcy, I started running incremental exploratory missions on this alien planet. I joined Science Olympiad, finding comfort in the companionship of fellow biology geeks. Fulfilling a longtime goal, I joined a volunteer station and became an EMT, loving the urgency of working in an ambulance and the unique satisfaction of saving a life. I spent countless hours reading papers about spinal cord stimulation, temporarily forgetting my social isolation with academic collaboration. I learned to drive, much to my parent’s chagrin.\n\nThough I still had the occasional bad day (as do we all), things were looking up. Reluctant optimism replaced hopeless despair as I became more confident in my abilities and less reliant on the context in which I applied them. Moving compelled me to meet different people, try new things, and succeed in an environment I hadn’t grown up in. The result was resilience, a firm belief that with hard work, a willingness to diversify, and a little self-deprecation, no situation was impossible, no crisis un-manageable.\n\n",

      "essay": "The rattle of a doorknob shook me awake, and then… BAM! A door slammed open. He’s coming, aided by his walker. Clunk. Shuffle. Shuffle. My clock read 4:27 AM. It was the third time tonight, a new record. The hall light switched on and in Chinese, my grandfather’s deep voice pierced the night against my mom’s whispers. As usual, he was disoriented, thought it was time to eat, and being hard of hearing, required loud convincing by my mom to return to bed.\n\nLater that morning, as my dad and I prepared breakfast, my grandfather hobbled into the kitchen. “Good morning, Yeye.” I said, still groggy from last night. Yeye’s eyes scanned the room. “Where am I?” he asked. I explained once again, “This is our apartment and your new home. Your wife, Maria, moved back to Taiwan last month, so now we are taking care of you.” I watched the sweet smile vanish from his face as he struggled to remember what had become fragmented by Alzheimer’s disease. Plaque and tangles had accumulated in his brain, and now they spread into our everyday lives.\n\nMy family was completely unprepared to care for a 90-year-old disabled man. There were no funds for professional elder care, so my mom, dad, and I had to quickly adapt to accommodate his needs. After a number of falls, we installed guardrails, a shower chair, and other safety equipment into the bathroom, which he shared with me!\n\nMy grandfather’s dementia erased the connection that he and I once shared. When I was younger, we used to solve math puzzles together, but now we couldn’t even hold a conversation. As I looked back, I realized Yeye had lived a sedentary senior life. Would a more active lifestyle have led to a different outcome? How do we live our final years with independence, health, and happiness?\n\nI’ve noticed that our American culture glorifies youth and nearly ignores what it means to grow old. While our secondary education system addresses the beginning of life, it fails to bring awareness to our final decades and how we will be supported during that time.\n\nWhenever there’s research to be done, my parents assign it to me. By reading many articles on elder care, I discovered that the senior population will exponentially skyrocket in the coming years due to the aging baby boomer generation. It became clear that a comprehensive resource was needed to educate this massive influx of seniors and their families.\n\nI am developing a mobile app to prepare families for elder care and maintain patients’ cognitive health. My app will enable users to complete advance care planning documents, compare elder care options for both in-home and outside facilities, and access practical resources such as videos and diagrams to help families assist their loved ones. Additionally, it will promote cognitive health through exercise, nutrition, sleep, brain games, and a daily journal. The games will be personalized to exercise memory, like matching the names of family members with their appropriate pictures. Users will be reminded to write or speak into their journal with thoughts and feelings to strengthen their reasoning skills. I am currently in the process of researching and designing a prototype for my app, and I plan to continue building it in college.\n\nYeye can no longer walk. While the challenges have increased, I have learned to appreciate the different stages of life and return the love and care that my grandfather once gave me. With this in practice, Yeye’s disposition improved and he accepted our home as his. My help is now received with gracious smiles and exclamations of “Wow, wow, wow!”, especially as I serve him meals. I am determined to sort through the tangles of life. So when I hear the doorknob rattle at night, I know it’s just a reminder for us all to make healthier choices today for a better tomorrow.",

      "essay": "A cow gave birth and I watched. Staring from the window of our stopped car, I experienced two beginnings that day: the small bovine life and my future. Both emerged when I was only 10 years old and cruising along the twisting roads of rural Maryland. While my country-bound aunt and cousin were barely phased, the scene struck my young and sheltered eyes. Along with a whirlwind of emotions, the unrestrained act of parturition triggered a feeling of warmth I will never forget.\n\nYears later I learned in biology that all women are biologically nurturing, physically and emotionally. What did that mean? At that point in my life, I could truly make no connection. My idea of femininity was locked in what society had shown me thus far. Femininity was wearing dresses, applying makeup, cheerleading, and giggling near the most popular jock in the entire middle school. In other words, things I did not exactly partake in.\n\nBut as I sat in the classroom, I didn’t think about my gender or how I relate to what society considers to be female. Rather, the discussion brought me back to that hot car, parked in front of that special birthing cow. I witnessed the essence of biological femininity as that cow radiated love and affection to her calf immediately after his arrival into the world. The cow represented the epitome of femininity: nurturement and selflessness.\n\nAs I have considered the idea of “biological femininity”, I have for years questioned how I fit in with that term. Admittedly, I stray far from the stereotypical female. However, according to developmental neuroscience, evolutionary biology, and studies of sex-based cognitive differences, I am empathetic and intuitive, and prefer language over logic— and that was all I needed. Through the birth of a calf, I realized that I did not need to be interested in “girl things” to be a girl. I did not need a characterized maternal figure to show me how to be a young lady. I certainly did not need a man to tell me how to be a woman. The qualities I possess internally give me all the femininity I need to be a female. There was no definition beyond that, nothing society could paint. That, I believed, was absolutely beautiful.\n\nThe future is female. Now that I am beginning to understand the fluidity of femininity, hearing those words empowers me. There are endless ways to live the female experience, no one experience more valid than another. Creativity, intuition, kindness, and love are the roots of femininity, while whatever blooms is up to the individual. With my roots firmly planted, I only need the opportunity to grow to create my future.\n\nWhen I began thinking of a future field of study and career, I didn’t hesitate; I knew I wanted to work with women. After my struggle with femininity, nothing else intrigued me more. The birth of the cow seven years ago was my inciting incident. My story must include the love, warmth, and beauty of that day. To be a part of the birth story of others entering this world and to study the life and love that preceded is my goal. Eventually, through whatever it takes, I will become an OB/GYN so I can work with women daily, helping teenagers through puberty and educating on sexuality, supporting women through their personal challenges, and assisting in the life-changing act of childbirth. I am dedicated to the future of women.\n\nA cow gave birth and I watched. That experience helped me to become the powerful, strong-minded, and passionate young woman I am today. In pursuing a doctorate I hope to encourage and guide other women to be their own best self and show through my actions and story that there is no one version of womanhood that is “right”, perhaps influencing a new generation.",

      "essay": "Please don’t blame me for the fact that I’m a bit bossy, a little neurotic, and sometimes a hypochondriac. I truly can’t help it. After all, I’m a Virgo, and that’s just how we are. But, hey, I make up for it with my charm, sensitivity, and creativity- I have my moon in Libra to thank for that.\n\nMy sister– a Sagittarius no doubt — is considered the smartest one of the family. She likes to ridicule my astrological obsession. Of course my family would laugh at me; they are a posse of self-assured fire signs who would never in a million years believe in anything science can’t explain. I’ve always been called the eccentric one. I am the odd one out in my family of left-brained logicians who won’t stand to accept anything outside their scope of rationality.\n\nI know, I know. There is no evidence that any of it is real. And believe me, I’m well aware of the plethora of data that proves me wrong. But for me, astrology isn’t about finding proof that any of it is real. Astrology is a belief system that I utilize for myself which gives me a unique perspective on the world. Whether it’s technically true or not has no bearing.\n\nAstrology allows me to appreciate the most unique qualities of the people I love most and teaches me to be more lenient in forgiving their transgressions. I notice the way my mother manifests the ambition and passion that only a Leo could possess. And though my best friend, Andrew, might get on my nerves with his characteristic Taurus stubbornness, I know I can always can look to him for advice- as his sign is the most loyal and affectionate. I often notice how my late father had the pure kindness and warmth in his soul that only a Cancer could have possessed. I smile knowing he once lived happily under same sky of stars that now inspires me.\n\nThe world can be cruel- I have witnessed that first hand. Yet, in times of darkness, what could be so wrong with looking up to the stars for a bit of light? People can be terrible, and their actions can hurt us beyond repair. The best way to maintain faith in humanity is to know that there is something good in just about everyone. Astrology can be a lens to see that goodness- to look on the bright side.\n\nPeople call me irrational and foolish for believing in something beyond logic. They actively search for inconsistencies in astrology and use them to evidence its falsehood. However, these skeptics are missing the point. If an idea can provide one with joy, renewed hope, or passion, why should it matter whether or not it’s real? By learning to appreciate the things that are whimsical, magical, or unbelievable, we open our hearts and minds to a better and happier worldview. It doesn’t matter if something is real to others, the fact that it is real to us should be good enough.\n\n  Astrology is my connection to humanity. It gives me an insight into the personality of every person I meet- a reassurance that everyone has something good within their hearts. Sure, I worry way too much, and yes, I can be a tad pessimistic and critical at times. That’s all fine. Because at the end of the day, I’m proud of how exceptionally independent, strong-minded, and empathetic I am. After all, I am a Virgo, and that’s just how we are.",

      "essay": "As I left home last July to fly nearly 5,000 miles to summer camp in the Pacific Northwest, it felt easier than ever before. Not only had I made the trip each summer since the age of 12, but I had been newly promoted from camper to counselor-in-training (CT), and the prospective change of role filled me with anticipation.\n\nMy CT summer last year was by far my most memorable. I finally had the opportunity to impact the lives of the next generation of campers in the same way my own counselors had impacted mine; however, this chance was equally exhilarating and daunting. While it did motivate me to excel at my job and present the best of myself, it also made me increasingly aware of my perceived shortcomings, especially after witnessing many of my peers thrive in their new roles. One became a prominent and well-respected basketball coach, having played at an elite level all through high school, while another was especially gifted at looking after the youngest children, having helped her father raise her siblings back home. Compared to their successes, I struggled to maintain self-confidence as I did not know if my effort was being equally well-received by the campers.\n\nHowever, one thing I was proud of by the midpoint of the session was the close friendship I had struck up and nurtured with one of the older campers while teaching his sailing class. This build up of trust culminated in him visiting my table one lunchtime and handing me a crumpled sliver of red paper, before scurrying away with a bashful grin. There is a strong tradition at camp of writing heartfelt letters to those for whom you are grateful, and this was one such note. Upon reading it that evening I collapsed onto my bunk, overcome with emotion. I lay there reflecting and reminiscing until late at night, before delicately tucking the paper into my journal. It detailed not only how I had greatly impacted and improved his camp experience, but that ‘I had become like a brother to him’, which I quote from the letter that is pinned to my bedroom wall even now.\n\nFrom that moment, my attitude for the rest of the session was markedly more confident, as I had received the assurance I was lacking. I channeled this confidence into teaching, working with the campers, and also into my personal relationships. After thanking my friend for the note, we further connected in an especially memorable conversation, where I shared some of my biggest fears surrounding loneliness, deteriorating friendships with my high school friends, and terrifying upcoming changes in my own life, such as moving abroad for college. In return, he entrusted me with his feelings about his troubled relationship with his parents and how that had affected his mental health, which he later admitted was the first time he had shared that.\n\nThe assurance and confidence I gained from the summer did not desert me once I returned home. For one, the practical skills I had gained through counseling made my job as a diving coach far easier, as I had more experience teaching and thus better understood how to productively and positively interact with the young divers. However, the biggest change was in my attitude towards the future. While I confided in my friend about my fear of moving away from the familiarity of home during the summer, upon further consideration it no longer fills me with the same sort of apprehension. The confidence and maturity I nurtured while at camp will continue to serve me well as I move into the next stage of my life.",

      "essay": "For my entire life, I have had the itch: the itch to understand.\n\nAs a kid I was obsessed with a universe I knew nothing about. In elementary school, my favorite book was an introduction to fulcrums for kids. Like the Pythagoreans who had marveled at the perfect ratios of musical notes, I was enamored with the mathematical symmetries of fulcrums. The book inflamed my itch but I had no means to scratch it.\n\nI was raised a San Francisco Hippie by musicians and artists. I learned to sing the blues before I knew the words I used. Without guidance from any scientific role models, I never learned what it meant to do science, let alone differentiate science from science-fiction. As a kid, it was obvious to me a flying car was equally as plausible as a man on the moon. When my parents told me my design for a helium filled broomstick would not fly, they could not explain why, they just knew it wouldn’t. My curiosity went unrewarded and I learned to silence my scientific mind to avoid the torture of my inability to scratch the itch.\n\nThen, in Sophomore year, I met Kikki. Before Kikki, “passion” was an intangible vocab term I had memorized. Ever since she lost her best friend to cancer in middle school, she had been using her pain to fuel her passion for fighting cancer. When you spoke to her about oncology, her eyes lit up, she bounced like a child, her voice raised an octave. She emanated raw, overwhelming passion.\n\nI wanted it. I was enviously watching another person scratch an itch I couldn’t.\n\nI was so desperate to feel the way Kikki did that I faked feeling passionate; AP Physics 1 with Mr. Prothro had sparked my old Pythagorean wonder in mathematics so I latched on to physics as my new passion and whenever I talked about it, I made my eyes light up, made myself bounce like a child, purposefully raised my voice an octave.\n\nSlowly, my passion emerged from pretense and envy into reality.\n\nWithout prompting, my eyes would light up, my heart would swell, and my mind would clear. One night, I was so exhilarated to start that night's problem set that I jumped out of my seat. I forgot to sit back down. I spent that night bent over at my desk, occasionally straightening out, walking around and visualising problems in my head. Five whiteboards now cover my walls and every night, I do my homework standing up.\n\nOnce learning became my passion, my life changed. Old concepts gained new beauty, the blues became a powerful medium of expression. Mathematics became a language rather than a subject. I rocketed from the kid who cried in class while learning about negative numbers to one of two juniors in an 800-person class to skip directly into AP Physics C and AP Calculus BC. I founded [School] Physics Club, which became one of the largest clubs in the school. Over the summer at Stanford, I earned perfect marks in Ordinary Differential Equations, Energy Resources, an Introduction to MATLAB, and an environmental seminar, all the while completing the Summer Environment and Water Studies Intensive. Now in my senior year, I am earning my AS in Mathematics and Physics at the City College of San Francisco.\n\nAs I enter college, the applicability of my field of physics offers me a broad array of high-impact careers. Given that by 2050, 17% of Bangladesh's land will be underwater displacing twenty million people, I have settled on energy resources engineering.\n\nAll of this is natural progression from one development - I learned to scratch my itch.",

      "essay": "As I sat alone in a crowded airport, I felt both excitement and nervousness. I took my laptop and opened it to the Facebook profile of my third cousin Joey. I remembered how curious I was the first time I learned about his existence. He seemed just like me. I could not have been more excited, for I was on my way to New Jersey to spend spring break at his parents’ house.\n\nIt may seem strange that I was so eager to meet a third cousin, as most Americans have minimal contact with relatives as distant as third cousins. Meeting distant relatives meant expanding the family tree, forming new connections, and expanding support networks. Setting down new roots by travelling to New Jersey to meet Joey not only felt right but also necessary.\n\nAfter landing and meeting Joey and his mom Alla, I felt awkward; we had absolutely nothing to discuss. ​Maybe visiting people I have never met was a mistake.\n\nThat night Alla explained to me that partner dominos was a family tradition dating back 50 years in the Soviet Union. I had never played dominos with a partner. Absolutely stunned, Alla cried, “YOU HAVE NEVER PLAYED PARTNER DOMINOS? HOW THE HELL IS YOUR MOTHER RAISING YOU?” The rest of the night we played partner dominos, and let me admit, I was awful. Nevertheless, I experienced a strong sense of belonging and connection to my heritage by taking part in an old family tradition. That game broke the ice and made me realize that we share a cultural and personal connection; starting with that game, I actually felt like we were family members. Unsure of what else my mom had neglected, Alla inundated me with an entire rundown of my extended family. I learned that I could travel to almost every continent, knowing there would always be someone to whom I am related. Due to my family’s Russian heritage, I would always be welcome, adept at partner dominos or not.\n\nA week later when I sat waiting for my flight home, I smiled. People whom I had just met, who had their own busy lives to live, took me in and made me feel welcome. At the end of the visit, I felt as if I had known Joey and Alla my entire life. I had to acknowledge that I had underestimated the need for extended family in my life. Furthermore, as I contemplated the transition from stranger to family member, my mind took me further to comprehend that whether related or not, I would live a more fulfilling life if willing to make vital connections. I consider every person with whom I forge a connection part of my “family” network, regardless of how remote. Though I had thought of “family” as merely a support system, I realized now that it is comprised of the people who, through powerful shared experiences, help one find a place in the world.\n\nWhen I launch into the next phase of my life, I am hoping to forge relationships with roommates, classmates, and professors. As a global citizen, I am also dedicated to connect with others and help them find a place in this world, just like Alla and Joey did for me.",

      "essay": "One in three victims of a heart attack don’t show any symptoms before it happens. Ninety-five percent of cardiac arrests that occur outside a hospital are fatal. These are not merely statistics. A heart attack redefined my life on November 21st, [Date].\n\nIt was a warm autumn morning, and I was raking leaves with my Boy Scout Troop to fundraise for our high adventure patrol’s 50-mile hike to summit Mt. Washington in New Hampshire. I had left my house on my bike early, without telling my mom—she was asleep, and my dad was at work.\n\nAbout an hour into raking, I saw my mother park nearby, and braced myself for a lecture about how my absence had freaked her out. No part of me imagined why she was actually there. Two words, delivered with the force of a Mack truck, “Dad died.” That morning on his routine break, his cardiac arteries became terminally obstructed. A heart attack and subsequent cardiac arrest ensued. That was it. No goodbye, no I love you, none of that.\n\nFrom there, my mind spiraled downward into an emotional void. I began to question my entire life—and how my father played into it. What did I last say to him? Did he know how much I loved him? I wanted to pinch myself and end the nightmare. But no, it was real life. In the subsequent weeks, there was no clarity or closure. The path I was travelling on was engulfed by thick fog. I questioned everything about life as I knew it: why do bad things happen to good people?—what does life mean?—how can I move forward?—how can the universe be so cruel? Three years later, I’m still searching for answers.\n\nMy father was wise, reserved, hardworking, and above all, caring. I idolized his humility and pragmatism, and I cherish it today. But after his death, I was emotionally raw. I could barely get through class without staving off a breakdown.\n\nLooking at my reflection in my dresser mirror one afternoon, I was examining my bloodshot, teary eyes when I noticed an old sticker of a black and white eye. When I was ten or eleven, I had gotten into trouble for playing video games too much, cursing, or some other youthful infraction. I was in my room as punishment after being scolded, when my dad came in. He placed this simple sticker on the mirror, and said, “Just remember, I’m always watching over you, no matter where I am.” When this happened, I knew he was being contextual about making sure I didn’t misbehave—but after his death, it seemed so omniscient and transcendental. When I look at that sticker, I know he’s with me.\n\nOne of my dad’s favorite adages was, “If you really think you’re doing your best—and it’s still not enough—make your best better.” When he would scold me about my grades, I always thought he was just being a “stickler,” demanding perfection. I know now that he was just encouraging me to do and be my best. His words have become my credo. During the entire year after his death, there were more than a few “firsts without dad”—first Christmas, first birthday, first Father’s Day, but also the first time I truly motivated myself. I think of my dad often, but never more than when I am pushing myself to succeed.\n\nOne in three victims are unaware they’re about to have a heart attack? Ninety five percent of cardiac arrest victims die? These statistics are just not good enough for me. As my dad would say, it’s time to make our best better to combat heart disease. My father is more than a statistic. His wisdom lives within me. When I face life’s obstacles, I know I can conquer them with him on my side.",

      "essay": "When I watched the Patriots and Falcons play in the Super Bowl in February of [Date], I had no idea that the next time I watched a football game I would be on the sidelines, right in the middle of all the action. However, that’s exactly what happened, and my experience as a football manager is not one that I will ever forget.\n\nAt the end of my junior year, the head football coach, Coach Cotter (who was also my AP Government teacher), asked me if I wanted to be a manager for the football team. He told me I would have to be at all the practices and games during the summer and throughout the school year. He made a compelling offer, but I turned him down because I didn't think I would have enough time during the summer with my classes, work, and vacation. One of my friends, however, took him up on his offer. In the middle of July, after hearing her talk about how much she enjoyed it, I asked her if she thought I would be able to join. After we spent a little bit talking about it, she asked if I wanted to go with her and see what it was like. I agreed, and I loved it. I asked Coach Cotter if he would mind if I joined, and I can still hear him saying, \"Absolutely, the more the merrier!\" in my head. The weeks of practice that followed, and then eventually the long Friday nights, proved to be an unforgettable experience.\n\nThe job of a football manager does not sound glamorous. Being at football practice for six hours every day during the summer and then three hours after school, surrounded by 47 sweaty football players and seven coaches who are constantly shouting is not how I planned to spend my summer and the fall of my senior year. But there was no way for me to know that this experience would teach me valuable lessons about life, regarding teamwork, hard work, and discipline.\n\nIn late July it was evident that some of the players were new and unsure of what to do. I watched as day after day the upperclassmen helped them learn their positions and become better players. This demonstration of teamwork impressed me, because instead of laughing at the younger players for not knowing what to do, they helped them become the best players they could be to make the team stronger. Once, three of our seniors got in trouble for some off field activities, and they had to sit out the first game, along with losing their helmet stickers that are given out for exceptional performances. I witnessed the effect that the consequences had on these players, and I heard one of our coaches after we lost the game tell them “Now you see how the consequences of your actions affected the entire team. Don't ever underestimate your importance to this team.” After that game, I saw the hard work that those boys put in to earn back their reputations and their helmet stickers. They taught me that even if I make mistakes, I will always learn from them no matter how much hard work it takes.\n\nWe managers go by many names: watergirls, team managers, hydration specialists. But none of these monikers can capture the rush of emotion I feel after a hard fought game, or the feeling of connectedness that comes every time we celebrate as a team after a victory, ringing our bell and blasting “Party in the USA.” My sense of school spirit has never been stronger. Throughout the summer, the three hours after school, and the seven hours I spend on game days with the players, I have learned lessons and developed relationships that I will never forget.",

      "essay": "“If you care about your future, you shouldn’t allow yourself to think such things.”\n\nMy mom used to tell me this a lot. She’d always disapproved of my passion for the arts.\n\nMy dreams are a few sizes too big for me and my parents make sure I’m well aware of it. In an ideal world, I’d have a knack for composing and singing sappy ballads and I’d be well on my way towards making it big in Korea’s music industry.\n\nHowever, my parents are firmly against my making music for a living. They’d rather have me study a more academically inclined subject, like law or business. I can’t blame them, either -- socially, any career in the arts is looked down upon. It’s true that fine arts careers are not as financially supportive as careers in scientific or mathematical areas of study. Music and arts are usually for consumer enjoyment, while science and math have real world “purpose”. However, without fine arts, our worlds would be empty and monochrome. They hold so much importance in our lives, yet people disregard them and forget that there are people behind these masterpieces of lyrical art, writing songs for a living.\n\nDuring my more frivolous years, I used to dream of becoming a singer-songwriter. Every time I brought it up with my parents, they’d laugh in my face and ask if I was joking. They’d say that if I truly cared about my future, I shouldn’t allow myself to have such dreams. It’s hard to become successful, they’d say, and compare me to all the people that have tried and failed. It was a little discouraging, to say the least. I hit the looming wall of my dilemma just last year -- how could I reconcile my passions with my parents’ wishes? Was there even a solution out there?\n\nEventually, I came to understand their viewpoint. It’s hard to deny the fact that careers in STEM are more profitable and sustainable. I still retain my love of music and desire to continue working on my ability, but now I’ve found another outlet of creativity: programming. The way so many components interact and come together to become something as equally as beautiful as song lyrics, albeit in its own way -- a polished mechanism, an aesthetic webpage, an organized and concise block of code. I used to be so reluctant to test the coding waters, content to reside on familiar shores, but it wasn’t difficult to experience the incredible joy of working through and solving problems.\n\nAs soon as I stepped into the world of computers, it felt as though a hundred doors had just opened in front of me. I could peek through the doorway of entrepreneurialism or the entryway of graphic design. I could easily get involved with AI and its moral questions, or create my own universe and every character. I could even stir in my passion for music by working with electronic music. And I think I’ve solved my dilemma.\n\nI discovered the concept of game design as an industry during the summer before senior year, when I had the pleasure of speaking to Sheri Graner Ray, a game design veteran. She told me about all of the different divisions -- the programming, the writing, and the audio -- and her own company, Zombie Cat Studios. She told me about her work in gender inclusivity within the industry. And once I kept searching for more, it felt as though the world of game design had been created for me. For the first time outside of music, I felt an incredible excitement to chase after a new dream. Being able to appease my parents was an added plus.\n\nIn the end, I don’t count on getting my parents’ approval of my passions any time soon. I hope to be able to prove myself to them eventually.\n\n",

      "essay": "If you are not the first, you are one of the rest. I always thought this was the key to happiness. Even when I was an infant, my mom used to say that I chose the people who could carry me. There were only two people: my mom and my sister, not even my dad.\n\nGrowing up, I always wanted to be the best in everything. And I was for the most part. I have a bunch of certificates: first in elocution competition, debates, patriotic song competitions, fancy dress, story narration, top 1% in the Macmillan math Olympiad, etc. In all the parent-teacher meetings, every teacher would say that my parents were blessed to have such a child and no one else stood a chance.\n\nEverything went great until I came second in the fifth grade in the annual examination. I just could not admit that I got defeated, that someone else was better than me. As the middle school period is when “who is the prettiest girl in class” came up, I lost there as well. Since that mattered a lot during the puberty stage, that cost me my confidence. I stopped talking to my friends because I thought they had this perception of me being ugly. It went to such an extent that I thought my parents felt the same way, so I’d never let them attend the parent-teacher meetings. I stopped participating in many activities.\n\nThen the ultimate burst: my sister, the one whom I’d let hold me, moved to the United States. That was the rock bottom; I felt so lonely and lost. I just isolated myself because I felt so insecure. I was afraid to be with myself. Still, I lingered on and immersed myself in something I knew I was good at and did not have to be social: academics. Then came the eighth grade. This was the most crucial period of my life. Just keep reading and you’ll know why.\n\nThis was when I was introduced to programming, and since I was always inclined to problem-solving and logical analysis, I was fascinated. When I could solve the problems my tutor gave me, I felt like I was solving problems in my real life and started to regain control (as I was when I was a baby). That’s how my passion for programming started. I delved further into this. This made me come out of that pitch-black pit. In my tenth-grade board exam, I was one among the few to get the perfect score in computer science. But I wasn’t ready to let this go after the tenth grade. I gave up a relaxed life for the Android development classes during my tenth-grade summer vacations.\n\nWhen I published my first app in the Google play store, I realized that this was the happiest I had ever been. So, does it make you happy if you are the best at everything? When was I the happiest— when I was the best at everything or when I was programming? The truth is that the former happiness was fleeting. It was for those few words of my teachers or my peers, but the latter was real. It’s true, that was harder to achieve but when I did come past all those little runtime errors and crashes, it made my day. So, the answer to the question is ‘no’. What makes you happy is you pursuing your passion.\n\nThe outcome: my attitude towards life changed. Nothing could pull me down anymore. Even if I didn’t top my class, I was happy because I knew my happiness was independent. The sheer spirit of chasing my dreams makes me happy. I will work hard to achieve them. You create your own destiny.",

      "essay": "My parents emigrated from Korea to the US and ran a Dairy Queen business in Florida, which unfortunately ended in bankruptcy as breakdowns in expensive equipment were too expensive to repair. After filing Chapter 7 bankruptcy and being evicted from our home, we stayed in our grandparent’s house for a while, before moving the 8,000 miles to Guam for my father to take a job teaching golf at the Leopalace Resort. My father began to receive delayed payments, and with the employer attempting to run off with my father’s last paycheck, he was laid off – this put an immense amount of pressure on my family and were particularly hard times. The stress of this particularly affected my mother, who was told by doctors she was “days away” from a heart attack during this time. Medical insurance was too expensive, so, to this day, she continues to commute every day to her job taking complaints at a hotel. I truly love her so I have made it my personal mission to help her in any way I can – preparing healthy meals, exercising together and caring for her. Since 6th grade, I have taken full responsibility of healthy meal planning, buying groceries, and preparing meals. I have loved scientific research since the 8th grade storing chemicals in kitchen cabinets and conducting experiments in my makeshift kitchen laboratory. In highschool, I moved out of my parent’s two-bedroom apartment and worked on independently designed research projects at the University of Guam for three consecutive years. I aspired to mitigate the effects of climate change wreaking havoc on our island. I see it first-hand, snorkelling over bleached coral reefs and living through barrages of supertyphoons. With a love for learning and undying resilience, I independently invented a patent-pending sustainable and paintable battery winning First Place and Best of Category at the Intel International Science and Engineering Fair in Materials Science. I felt incredibly proud to represent my island and find innovation in a tiny lab in Guam. My three-year ongoing research project was done independently. I poured thousands of hours into my passion project, turning my kitchen into a laboratory and later moving into a university lab. My research and experimental results were vetted by materials companies/scientists who I cold emailed. I custom-built my own equipment, acquired thousands of dollars of free chemicals from materials companies, designed dozens of prototypes and synthesized thousands of material formulations, tweaking every possible parameter leading to the invention of a new patent pending material for “paintable” solutions towards clean energy and sustainable electronics. To pursue my passion for research, I always had to ask my friends for rides all the way to the university and used any money I had to take taxis to the university (lack of mobility is an issue with two working parents). I stayed at the laboratories from 4-9pm and often lacked money to buy dinner after paying for the taxi, so the Chemistry professor would often buy me food and the science fair organizer on Guam would give me money to print my posters for the Intel International Science and Engineering Fair and other all expense paid science conferences. I’m so grateful for my island community that has helped me out, amidst my background. I dream of pursuing a master’s in materials science and giving back to the outer islands of Micronesia through both scientific research and outreach. I look forward to pursuing my passions and giving back to my island that has given me so much.\n\n",

      "essay": "When I was nine years old, I was obsessed with “Cloud Bread,” a Korean TV show about a family of cats who capture clouds from the sky to make bread, letting them fly and go on enchanting adventures. I was hopelessly addicted.\n\nMy nine-year-old self believed in the idea that anything was possible and that there was always an answer. I excitedly prodded my mother with a flurry of questions:\n\n“How can you catch a cloud?”\n\n“Why can’t people fly?”\n\n“Can I make bread that lets me fly?”\n\nShe told me it wasn’t possible, but I wouldn’t give up that easily. I raided the kitchen, seizing aluminum pots and pans from our dusty oven. Flinging open the pantry and fridge, I collected flour, water, eggs, and sugar—ingredients I had seen in “Cloud Bread”—but one was missing. I needed a cloud. Cotton candy was airy, light, and looked pretty close to one, which was good enough for me. I mixed cotton candy into a colorful dough, and as I punched the stretchy concoction, adding air until it resembled a fluffy cloud, I suddenly remembered I had never used an oven before.\n\nGazing at the shiny metal dials, I propped myself up onto a kitchen chair and reached toward them. I casually fiddled with the oven knobs, but my mother suddenly looked at me in terror, her face paler than any bread dough. She yanked me from them, and yelled, “DANIEL, DO NOT TOUCH THE OVEN!” I felt like I had committed a crime, but she was simply happy that I didn’t burn myself or the house down.\n\nSince then, I have grown both physically (I no longer need to stand on furniture to reach the oven dials) and intellectually. My cloud bread experience didn’t make me shy away from the kitchen, but rather, it motivated me to experiment even further. I spent hours picking spiky soursop fruits from the tree outside our apartment and whipping egg whites for flavored meringues, testing exotic flavor combinations like passionfruit and rhubarb. Though my first experiments were with food, my kitchen quickly became my lab, where I could nurture my passion for creating and experimenting, even with non-edible ingredients.\n\nFive years after the cloud bread incident, I frantically scoured the internet for a showstopping science fair idea. I was allured by Youtube tutorials on creating turbojet engines and gliders. With the same cloud-bread optimism I researched the methodology, but as an eighth-grader living in a tiny village, I lacked the scientific resources to launch full-scale engineering prototypes and instead turned to a more innovative approach. I asked myself What can I test in my kitchen?\n\nI turned to the internet again for inspiration, stumbling on a video about a Turkish girl who derived plastic from banana peels. Intrigued by the idea of concocting my own recipes, I whipped up a formula of my own—baked cornstarch, water, and fruit peels—that ultimately turned into colorful plastics. The simplicity of being able to create impactful prototypes with such mundane materials inspired several of my ideas to come, but banana peels weren’t always sufficient. Ideas filled my mind, such as what if I used potato starch instead of cornstarch? or what if I add coconut fibers to the mix?\n\nSeeking more than kitchen chemistry, I moved my experiments out of my parent’s two-bedroom apartment and into the University of Guam chemistry lab, working feverishly on everything from airplane plastics to converting tubs of artists’ paint into vats of paintable wires.\n\nAlthough now I know bread won’t let me fly, a part of that childlike imagination still lingers inside me. Whether I’m pursuing research into nanotechnology, talking with my international peers at Intel ISEF, or simply baking bread, I bring the same childlike imagination that—when combined with the realistic ambitions of an adult—enables me to always be on the lookout for my next cloud bread adventure.",

      "essay": "“What can you see?” the lady in the white coat asked me.\n\n“E,” I said, staring at the biggest letter on the top of the eye chart.\n\n“Anything else?” she inquired.\n\n“Umm…No,” I shook my head. Everything below the first line was a blur.\n\nThus, at the age of five, I was officially diagnosed with severe myopia.\n\nThe optometrist then shoved a monstrous gadget in my face, repeatedly asking me to read the eye chart while she changed the lenses. Finally, a clear line of letters emerged before me and the world beyond arm’s reach suddenly became clear for the first time. I then received a pair of glasses. Although it was thick and unsightly, it represented a freedom I previously did not have. A whole new horizon opened up in front of my eyes.\n\nMy vision further expanded when my dad introduced me to photography. Equipped with a point-and-shoot camera, I started taking random pictures – the sky, a frog, a mountain range. For a kindergartener, being able to see the world through a different lens was a fresh and exhilarating experience.\n\nAs I grew older, my photography evolved in complexity and meaning. In high school, I worked and saved enough money to buy a DSLR, a Canon Rebel, with which my art began to take on a more abstract direction, incorporating variables such as focus, lighting, and perspective. In one of my first projects, I put together several pieces of bent paper to form a structure, which took on the appearance of a grand palace when light shone on it at a certain angle. In another, I juxtaposed a seashell and a potato chip, illuminating commonalities shared by vastly different objects. My vision of the world grew as my photography transformed from the mere recording of photons to an art form.\n\nI began to enter and win photography competitions, and one of my works was published in a book, one featured at the University of San Diego gallery, and another at the Calabasas Teen Arts festival. The highlight of my “career” was the day the mayor of Calabasas handed me the award for best photograph, emphatically stating “Great work. It’s so real I could almost touch it!”\n\nStationary photographs transformed into moving images when I took up cinematography. One of my earliest films was an educational video about macromolecules, which launched my YouTube channel. With encouragement from my peers, I made several other short films on a variety of topics, ranging from a Western-style duel to a metaphorical story about self-discovery. For my school robotics team, I created a film utilizing a helicopter, a steadicam, and a rotating platform. My work won 1st place at the VEX online challenge and advanced our team to world championships.\n\nTo date, my most ambitious film project has been an anti-war documentary centered on the experiences of a Vietnam War veteran. This piece was the product of my summer study at the USC School of Cinematic Arts, which introduced me to the wonders of modern day filmmaking. During my interview with the veteran, I had to ask deeply personal and often uncomfortable questions involving the horrors of war and its aftermaths. Memories of killing a 14-year-old boy, losing fellow soldiers, and suffering from PTSD came bubbling to the surface. This project was unlike any of my others, for it challenged me to find new ways to pursue knowledge and, in the process, broadened my sphere of awareness.\n\nDorothea Lange once said, “The camera is an instrument that teaches people how to see.” Indeed, the camera is a medium which has enabled me to see clearly and allowed me to learn about humanity in greater breadth and depth. My biological eyes no longer limit what I can see.\n\nI have found my place behind lenses.\n\n",

Why won’t you go back to your country, you terrorist? My answer is…uncomfortable. Many truths of the world are uncomfortable. A couple of examples are that an equal number of pets are euthanized as are adopted each year and that cats roam the streets at night because they are actually looking for owners with better food. One of those statements is a horrible truth and the other is a thought I had in the shower. Either way, the point still stands. Uncomfortable truths are just that, uncomfortable. The answer to ‘Why won’t you go back to your country, you terrorist?’ is the most uncomfortable answer I can give, barring the current status of aboriginal street cats.\n\nSikhs like myself have borne the brunt of the backlash through our forced subjection to hate crimes, bullying, and job discrimination. In [Date], a misguided gunman took the lives of six Sikhs who were praying peacefully in their house of worship in Oak Creek, Wisconsin. Their families, through their tears, asked the nation, like I continue to ask myself, “Why?”\n\nThe uncomfortable truth is that as a society, we have not found a solution to the growing trend of extremism and hate crimes—we failed at the whole “freedom of religion” clause in the Bill of Rights. The media tells us that these crimes are carried out by individuals that are ignorant and motivated by hate. I would personally call them losers, but that would solve none of underlying system problems that have grown from anti-immigration rhetoric. When my cousin joined the US Army, he was told that he’d have to cut his beard and hair. Every time I tell that part of the story I can’t help but guffaw at how ridiculous it sounds. My then eleven-year-old angst came to a climactic fruition hearing those words—it was a call to action.\n\nI helped to gather signatures for a petition to Robert Gates, then Secretary of Defense, pleading with him to allow Sikhs to serve without having to cut our hair. We garnered over 15,000 signatories, receiving generous media attention. We called and convinced our local congressional offices to support this issue. I created a Facebook page to help spread awareness, and helped to organize fundraisers to help fight this ban on our articles of faith. Our message is simple. Through service, we can push back against both hate and intolerance. But, if the largest employer in the U.S. does not allow us to serve with our articles of faith, then we will continue to be victimized as outsiders, contrary to the founding principles of our nation.\n\nI’m proud to say my cousin deployed to Afghanistan as the first Sikh to be granted a religious waiver in nearly a generation. He saved countless lives as a doctor on the front lines of war and was awarded the Bronze Star Medal for his efforts. But, (there’s always a but) Sikhs today still face a presumptive ban. Despite being in perfect—for the army’s sake—physical condition, I cannot join the US Army because of my hair.\n\nSo now the uncomfortable story that was the uncomfortable answer to an uncomfortable question comes to an uncomfortable ending. And, like all great uncomfortable answers, I never really answered the main question. I don’t have the answers to why people do the hateful things they do. But by wearing my turban proudly every morning, by answering questions when they come up, by being willing to talk about everything that is wrong, I become a personification of what is right. My solution to the systemic problem starts with me.",

      "essay": "“SunHee? Isn’t that an Asian name? Aren’t you black?”\n\nYes, my name is actually SunHee. Yes, it’s Asian. Yes, I am indeed black. From a young age, I’ve always carried a name that I considered too out of the ordinary. SunHee, a Korean name meaning “princess of goodness and righteousness”, packed a great deal of power and responsibility- both of which I didn’t believe I was capable of upholding. I also didn’t have an ounce of Korean blood in me. As a result, it was foreign to both myself and others.\n\nSometimes, when you’re different from the rest of the crowd, it becomes overwhelming and the loneliness prompts you to assimilate. There were points in my life where I was extremely embarrassed of what I believed to be the oddest thing about me: my name.\n\nSubsequently, I began to deny its existence and use my middle name. “You can just call me Khacy (K-C) ” was the phrase that immediately followed any introduction. I had teachers change my name on attendance sheets and I ignored friends until they called me by my “correct” name. It got to the point where only my parents and family friends called me SunHee anymore. This went on for so long that I almost forgot the name “SunHee” was mine. I couldn’t come to terms with the entirety of my identity because of a two syllable sound.\n\nHowever, you can only stay in the dark for so long. One day, I wasn’t quick enough in correcting a person who called me by my first name and immediately an acquaintance jokingly said:\n\n“Sunny? Oh, Sunny like Sunny D!”\n\nImmediately, I remembered the slogan of the sugary drink: “The power-packed taste of Sunny D! Unleash the power, unleash the sun!”\n\nAt 6 years old, the Sunny D drink commercial was filled with tacky actors on a low quality TV. Nevertheless, younger me was excited at the prospect of getting to drink the delicious “power of the sun in liquefied form”. My memories of Sunny D were fun because it stood out amongst the boring milks and fruit juices in our fridge; it’s bright orange color and decorated banner wasn’t only pleasing to the eye but satisfied my thirst every time.\n\nSimilar to my fridge, we live in a society where we’re taught that unusual is weird and fitting into a crowd is essential. We are told to be unique, but are criticized if our uniqueness doesn’t fall within certain standards of “cool”. Until that moment, I didn’t realize how relevant a drink could be to my life. A pun about my name unleashed a new confidence within me that I didn’t know I had.\n\nA nickname was all it took for me to recognize that there is no name more fitting for me than my first one. When I debate, I unleash the power of my voice. When I interact with my peers and my teachers, I unleash a sunny personality. When I perform to fundraise and witness for my church and community, I unleash power-packed songs. Everything I do- be it academic or social -is an embodiment of the sunniness within me.\n\nI didn’t understand that the beauty I possessed came from the unique person I was and always will be. Some believe a name only has pragmatic value but it’s so much more than that. It’s a tag that follows you for a lifetime and shapes who you are. I have a name from which people can make endless puns but also call me a princess every time they want my attention- which is pretty powerful! Recognizing the meaning and flexibility of my name has made me stronger, more confident and reflects in the way I carry myself. I will continue to be the Sunny D amongst boring milks and juices. I’ll stand out, be comfortable in my own skin, and let my brilliance shine through.",

      "essay": "Math had always been the easy, simple subject for me until calculus suddenly turned math into a terribly fascinating new world for me to explore. My paradigm regarding the seemingly rigid discipline shifted from indifference to a desire to learn how the puzzle pieces of the world clicked and fitted together. I hoped to spread that sentiment by establishing Mu Alpha Theta at my school, a chartering process that I expected to last at most two months.\n\nThat preconceived notion could not have been further from the truth. After an arduous month involving hours of research, several phone calls, and admittedly, some pestering, I gained approval to start the chartering process in the second semester of my junior year. Immediately, I wrote the charter application, bylaws, supplementary materials, and student application for the math department to review. Unfortunately, as each error was traded in with another, I realized that my predicted timeframe was an over-optimistic dream. The lag was attributed to the lack of cohesive communication and initiative; I kept pushing my responsibilities to the next week until there was no more time left. Consequently, I took greater measures to accomplish my goals by setting hard deadlines for myself and approaching the math teachers more frequently for feedback.\n\nAfter seven months, the math department and I have just finished the application process and are reviewing the candidates. Seeing my passion manifest into a tangible organization excites me, and I hope that it does the same for my school’s community.\n\n",

      "essay": "Matsuyo wrapped her aged hands around mine. She had been uncommunicative and unable to feed herself for some time. Slowly, she began mouthing along as I sang “Aki-no-yuuhi,” a traditional Japanese melody.

My responsibilities at Sunrise include spending one-on-one time with residents and leading group activities such as exercise, current events, meditation, flower arrangement, sing-alongs, baking, and gardening. I also began a weekly “Summer Arts and Crafts with Grace” activity and taught crocheting, sculpting, painting, and jewelry making. I sometimes give violin concerts as well. The residents and staff at Sunrise got to know me so well that Sunrise offered me a job (which I unfortunately could not take), and one of the residents, Mama T, refers to me as her granddaughter.\n\nVolunteering has made me appreciate that members of my community are indeed my family, and family members look out for and support each other.

I was a complete novice, but slowly, slowly, I learned how to tap.\n\nAfter an entire semester of hard work, the “Anything Goes” cast list was posted, and I received a featured tap role.

      "essay": "Is it possible to fill everyone’s proverbial water cup? In “Tian Guan Ci Fu” (“TGCF”, or “Heaven Official’s Blessing” in English), this Water-Cup-Conundrum was answered. A State Preceptor once presented his Prince with the conundrum:\n\n“If 2 men were walking in the desert about to die from thirst and you only had 1 cup of water to offer, which man would you give the cup to?” \n\nThe Prince answered: “Both.”\n\nThe State Preceptor was perplexed: “There’s only 1 cup of water.” \n\n“Then I’d create a cup,” the Prince declared. “I’d ascend to the heavens, become a God, and create a cup.” \n\nThough the State Preceptor called him insane, the Prince stood firm. And I stand with the Prince, because I believe our world is positive-sum, where water cups can be created, and not zero-sum, where we’re forced to choose whose cup to fill.\n\nAll my life, I’ve acted as a bridge between parents, juggling the seemingly impossible task of trying to fill both cups when they’d demand I pick a side and fill only one cup. Consequently, I’ve been able to steer them away from divorce and towards a closer relationship than ever before, 30 years into marriage. Had I chosen just one side, my family wouldn’t still be whole.\n\nThis “fill-both-cups” philosophy has extended to my professional life. I’m an advocate for increasing the International Affairs budget and allocating more funding towards fighting extreme poverty. As a Political Ambassador for [ORGANIZATION NAME], a nonprofit dedicated to fighting extreme poverty, I have been lobbying Congress to increase foreign aid and help those in dire need. In January, I met with Senator Ted Cruz’s office to request an increase in foreign aid. From my research, Texas’s biggest trade partner is Mexico, and U.S. foreign aid has doubled trade with Mexico. National foreign aid has reaped economic benefits for Texas, meaning allocating more funds towards the International Affairs budget is a win-win policy, benefitting the state of Texas.\n\nThough some, like the State Preceptor in “TGCF”, believe it to be impossible to create more abundance for all, evidence proves them wrong. In the book, the Prince ascends to Godhood and does the previously unthinkable - he descends to the mortal world to end wars and create peace, proving the impossible possible. Most importantly, the Prince represents the existence of win-win situations where abundance can be created and both cups can be filled.\n\nWholeheartedly, I believe that allocating funds to benefit other countries, especially to fight extreme poverty, is an example of creating another cup. Small investments to help the poor in foreign countries create large returns on investment for America. The world’s fastest growing economies often buy U.S. goods and expand American economic prosperity. Just like the Prince bet on himself to fill both cups and turned out to ultimately achieve the impossible, disregarding the Preceptor’s disbelief, I will continue to fill both cups - creating abundance where there is none.",

I naturally reach out to people, and as a result, I am able to accomplish projects like establishing a mentoring program for the French Honor Society and a threefold increase in membership for the Asian American Club. However, my outgoing personality made the most memorable impact at the “Conversation with Michelle Obama,” an event for which I was nominated to attend. Through Google Hangout, several American cities were able to connect to Michelle Obama in South Africa. When the Kansas City group was asked about technology integration in education, the students all froze underneath the limelight. In a burst of courage, I blurted a couple of words and consequently received the microphone to continue. At that moment, it didn’t matter that there were thousands of people around the world including Michelle Obama listening; it was just me and my string of thoughts. I was the only person in Kansas City to speak that day.\n\nI distinguish myself with my enthusiasm, and I easily see myself thriving as a part of the tight-knit community, the risk-taking hacking culture, and the passionately nerdy student population of MIT. After all, I still keep in touch with my lime-green carded tour guide.\n\n",

      "essay": "On my parents’ 22nd wedding anniversary, we received the dreaded call. My grandfather, my father’s father, had succumbed to Covid-19. He died alone due to Covid restrictions. He and my grandmother had flown from [STATE] to [CITY] so that my grandmother could have a hip replacement at [HOSPITAL NAME]. He contracted Covid while in [CITY]  and, in a tragic twist of events, he ended up dying in that very same hospital. When a loved one passes away, they are torn away from us, leaving a tear in our lives where they once were. In Judaism, we tear our clothes in mourning to symbolize our pain and sorrow. Sadly, the tears in our family fabric happened long before my grandfather died from Covid.\n\nSpecifically, my father married a gentile. Typically, in the Jewish religion, it is expected that one marry another Jew: \"You shall not marry them (the gentiles, about which the Torah speaks in the previous verses), you shall not give your daughter to their son, and you shall not take his daughter for your son.\" The reason for this prohibition is clearly spelled out in the following verse: \"because he will lead your son astray from Me and they will serve strange gods…\"\n\nMy father was raised in a reform Jewish family. They were not very observant but, culturally, their Jewish identity was meaningful. It was important to his family that he become a bar mitzvah when he turned 13. The portrait of him reading from the Torah on the bima has always been proudly displayed in my grandparents’ home. I even used his yad (Torah pointer) and kiddush cup when I became a bar mitzvah. I think that my grandmother, however, wasn’t thrilled that my father fell in love with a non-Jew. \n\nJudaism is matrilineal, meaning one born to a Jewish mother is Jewish. My mother chose to convert from Catholicism to Judaism in her first year of marriage. She wanted her future family to be of one faith and, learning about the religion through my father, she eagerly converted to Judaism and embraced the customs and traditions. So my brother, my sister, and I are all Jewish through birth: matrilineally. \n\nOver the course of my parents’ happy 25 years of marriage, my grandmother has never warmed up to my mother; if anything, she became overtly hostile. Because of her disdain, my immediate family has been ostracized. While I was growing up, my parents tried to please her, but it was always tense at birthdays, holidays, recitals, and the like. We were left out of most family get-togethers. Even while at my grandparents’ home cheering for our beloved [FOOTBALL TEAM NAME], it seemed my family was on a separate team. My grandmother treated my mother like an outsider and, by default, me.\n\nOne person who never made my mother or any member of my family feel left out, however, was my grandfather. He did his best to knit the family together. He was a kind, intelligent, hard-working role model who I’ve always strived to emulate. He had a long career as a [PHYSICIAN] in [STATE], loved attending my piano recitals so much that he began piano lessons at the age of 80, and even sparked my love of fishing when I was five and he took me to a small pond near his home. He rarely missed one of my tennis matches and was supportive when I lost. Education was crucial to him, so he encouraged me to study and get good grades. \n\nMy grandfather greatly enjoyed his time spent with us. One of my fondest memories is climbing into my grandfather’s old, wooden, black-and-gold chair. He told me it was his Harvard chair. On my father’s 40th birthday, my grandfather proudly presented my father with his own Harvard chair. He told me that if I worked really hard in school, someday I might get a shot at attending Harvard and becoming a third-generation alumni to continue their legacy. He said maybe someday I’d be the caretaker of all three chairs. I didn’t really know what Harvard was at that time, but I knew that no matter what happened, I was determined to make my grandfather and my father proud. I did what my grandfather said: I studied hard and got great grades, I trained hard and played great tennis, and I practiced hard and played great piano. As I write this, I am sitting in my father’s Harvard chair. \n\nBecause of the rift in my family, I rarely saw my grandfather the last two years of his life. My parents threw him a party for his 80th birthday, which he loved because he was at the beach surrounded by all of his children and grandchildren. My parents invited them for birthdays, recitals, and Mother's Day, but my grandmother always said “no”. Looking back, I bet he would’ve loved to attend each event. After all, he moved to [CITY] to be with family. He would’ve loved that I’m applying to Harvard now, as it was always something he wished for me and of which he knew I was capable. I wonder what his application process was like back in the 1950s… \n\nNow, my grandfather is gone, and I have to wonder if all of the heartache was worth it. What did my grandmother gain by not welcoming my mother into the family? Her intolerance cheated us of time with my grandfather that we will never get back. But thanks to him, my background is as diverse as it comes. I’m a direct descendent of [SEVERAL INDIVIDUALS] who were involved in the Salem Witch Trials. I have a great, great grandmother from [COUNTRY] and great grandparents from [COUNTRY]. Diversity adds to families. Just as my father introduced her to Judaism, my mother brought gifts from her side, like excellent cooking, art, music, and height. Ultimately, I’m so glad that my parents found each other because, together, they made me.\n\n",

      "essay": "Nothing drains the hope from the very core of my soul as much as scrutinizing the joys of Utah politics. I grew up in a state bombarded by the never-ending narrative of the broken nature of the political system meant to represent my fellow citizens and me. Party supermajorities seemingly dominate most governmental branches available. Utah districting ensures huge advantages to particular political parties, and elected officials appear to cling to office for a decade or longer no matter how egregious their actions are. However, I have a penchant for taking on seemingly impossible tasks and have also suffered from a begrudging but stubborn infatuation with politics since middle school when I became as addicted to CNN as I was to cartoons. So, partly due to a whim but primarily due to a budding desire to involve myself in the political sphere, I took on an internship under Utah House politician [NAME], who would be running for an at-large seat on the [CITY COUNCIL] during the [DATE] midterms. \n\nMy first assignment was to help run a campaign kick-off fundraiser attended by celebrities of [STATE] politics, including former and current mayors, [STATE] House and Senate members, and even previous federal politicians. After I spent the night starry-eyed, rushing to meet politician after politician until my feet swelled in my too-small dress shoes, I thought that I had already experienced what would be the best moment of my internship days after it began. Though I was right that it would be a moment I’ll always cherish, I was wrong to believe it would be the pinnacle of my internship experience. \n\nAs the summer months rolled in, the bustle of the campaign truly ignited, and the hard work began. While completing what most people would view as the most mundane tasks, I discovered the extraordinary aspect of politics: the utter humanity undergirding every part of the campaign process. As part of a small, grassroots campaign, I spent almost all my time face-to-face with citizens across the county, granting me the privilege of hearing from people with wildly different opinions. As I handed out literature and signs at parks, I engaged in conversations about people’s takes on what it truly means to be a Democrat in [STATE] or about what we must do to increase political activism throughout the state. As I knocked on door after door in neighborhoods countywide until my knuckles bruised while canvassing, I was met with takes on governance and cost of living radically different from my own but deeply interesting all the same. As I pored over spreadsheets to reach out to campaign donors, I noted the vast variety of people who chose to support our campaign. These interactions exposed me head-on to the people behind every election and statistic that finds its way into the news. They gave me a renewed sense of purpose as I was reminded daily of the infinitely large impact politics had the potential to exert on my community, something I simply had not been able to conceptualize before my hands-on experience. Above all, it reminded me why accepting diverse opinions and reconciling differences is necessary, something I had forgotten the importance of.  \n\nMy time in debate encouraged me to value contradictory beliefs early on. I reveled in spending hours getting intellectually destroyed by other students across the country all with the chance to learn from other debaters’ unique understandings of issues and examine my own in relation to this diversity of thought within the world of debate. Yet, I had struggled to apply that to the real world and suffered from a lack of willingness to budge on my political views after growing up in a world defined by hyperpolarization and a general refusal to cede any ground on divisive societal issues. That is why my internship represents a fundamental shift in how I view the world. As I have increasingly encountered people deeply affected by politics, I recognize the necessity to push for dialogue that will result in action. Those same people, the ones who were willing to have long talks on their porches about issues on their minds and the ones who offered cool water bottles when I was canvassing in [STATE]’s suffocating summer heat, would be the ones who suffered if political dialogues failed to materialize into tangible action. So, I learned to embrace difference rather than balk at it, transforming my methods to make change from ones that would align with my interests to ones that acknowledged other perspectives I would be completely blind to otherwise. \n\nFrom now on, I’ve made a vow to strive for the uncomfortable and the challenging. Living in a state where my views represent the minority is something I now see as a gift. Every conversation is an opportunity to learn something new because no one thinks the same way I do, and that is a wonderful, not undesirable aspect of humanity. So, I won’t be the next victim of the ideological dogmatism that has dehumanized modern politics. People who seek to change the world through actions informed only by their own perspectives will always fall short because their actions will serve themselves rather than the people impacted by those initiatives.",

      "essay": "If asked to draw a family tree my hand would still over the white canvas, not knowing where to begin. Where there was once a towering tree with strong branches, now there is only the jagged edges of an axe to wood. An axe I never had control over, an axe of loss, choice, and circumstance. At six, as I sat pondering what color to use for the trunk of my family tree, I lamented its barren-nature. Fruitful branches higher up on the tree, cleanly sliced from the trunk, leaving no sign of their presence, but for a small scab of bark. These branches were victims of family that came before me, that following a family quarrel, took the liberty of wildly swinging the axe at the tree, taking with them wise grandparents, boisterous cousins, and giddy aunts that I’ll never meet. I chose yellow. Optimistically, I thought of it as “trimming”, better to have a healthy tree, than one riddled with brittle branches.  The following year, the axe swung again. This time I left my crayons in their box. My father’s branch had been severed too soon, and with its loss, the others around it withered, leaving my tree lopsided. My father’s side barren, and my mother’s scarce. After the age of seven, I lost the little love I had left for drawing family trees. As other kids decoupaged colorful leaves and attached gold-toned pictures to crayon-drawn Giant Sequoias, I was left with a stump, unable to place members on its branches, or know the depths of its roots. \n\n\n\nFor a while, I resigned myself to an incomplete family tree; yet, I couldn’t forget my yellow trunk, colored by an optimistic six year old, so at fifteen, my relentless curiosity gave way and I began my journey to explore my roots. With a quick swab, and a month of patience, I soon had my ancestry results.\n\n\n\nI have held on to these results for two years, in hopes of one day doing what all teens in American coming of age movies seek to do- embark on a journey of self-discovery. These movies emphasize explorative journeys of self-discovery where rebellious teens break free from their familial chains to discover their own path. In contrast to these stories, I believe my journey of self-discovery begins in the very connections these characters are adamant on breaking. I seek self-discovery in its purest form, as a way to first understand myself and my origins, before seeking to grow beyond them. If I took a gap year, my explorative journey would begin in [COUNTRY], a beautiful seaside town where my ancestors once lived. Perhaps they were dock workers with weathered hands, and salt-sprayed overalls, who labored under the beating sun, and had a penchant for [CITY]-grown tobacco, or maybe they were traditional fado singers, cozied into dark cafes and pubs, singing their melancholic song as they strummed their guitars with worn fingers. Next, I would visit the [CONTINENT]. I’ve never been much of a hiker, but my ancestors must have been, to navigate the high peaks and plateaus of the mountains. Perhaps they were ceramicists, with clay always caught beneath their nails and their hands stained three different colors from their mineral paint. Their houses beautifully decorated with their ceramics, depicting folk tales and family history.  Perhaps they were teachers of the [LANGUAGE], seeking to preserve it from the threat of globalization, carefully reciting [NON-ENGLISH SENTENCE], “Hello, How are you?” to eager students. They represent the rich cultural history of the [ETHNICITY], dedicated to preserving their history through breath-taking art and language. After, I would visit [COUNTRY], staying in [CITY] in hopes of watching their most popular sport, [SPORT]. Perhaps my ancestors in [COUNTRY] were of an older time, where [SPORT] was not for sport, but part of the preparation for battle, or perhaps they are still around as wrestlers seeking [NON-ENGLISH WORD], or “honor”. This evolution is a reminder to remain connected to tradition, celebrating it with others.  Lastly, I would visit [COUNTRY], taking a train across the [COUNTRY] countryside, breathing in the crisp Autumn air and witnessing the changing foliage. Perhaps my ancestors once did the same, cozying up in their seats with a worn copy of Bram Stoker’s “Dracula”, as stone houses flitted past their windows on their way to [RESTAURANT NAME] for the best bowl of [ETHNICITY] Stew. A reminder to appreciate life as it happens, taking in beautiful scenery and inspiring literature.\n\n\n\nMy gap year would allow me to fill in the “gap” in my ancestry. Although the plan for my gap year began with the intention of adding new branches to my tree and learning the depths of my roots, so that I too could color in a family tree, along the way, I realized that maybe I would never have a Giant Sequoia, but I could have a quilt. My family quilt would be made up of all the experiences of those who came before me, my dockworkers, ceramicists, wrestlers, and bookworms, each of their stories colorful patches of my quilt. Knowing my ancestry is an assurance that I am not the sapling I once thought I was, with no roots to hold her down in the face of a storm, rather, I am capable of paving my own path, supported by the comforting presence of my family quilt draped over my shoulders. Though this trip wouldn’t mark the conclusion of my journey of self-discovery, it would be the embarkment of something great. My journey is sure to be fruitful, teaching me that when difficulties arise, I will be able to turn to my family quilt, tracing the stitching between patches, and take comfort in the resilience and passion of those that came before me.\n\n",

With opportunities to explore my interests in politics, education policy, and Artificial Intelligence, Harvard’s academic opportunities serve as the perfect petri dish for my specific interests.\n\nEntering as a sophomore, Harvard’s classic “Road to the White House” course would serve as my academic introduction to political races, with lectures including how candidates prepare for public speaking and the presidential image that candidates are expected to exude. I’ll be taking notes not just to excel in the class, but to craft my own public image as a public servant moving forward! Because all Government concentrators are allowed to meet 2 of their elective requirements through courses at the Harvard Kennedy School (HKS), I’d be elated to cross-enroll in HKS. Specifically, I’ve read Professor Roger Porter’s book Presidential Decision Making and would be thrilled to take Professor Porter’s class “The Business-Government Relationship in the United States” as an entrepreneur and aspiring political candidate. To further deepen my understanding of public policy, I’d join the Institute of Politics' Policy Program, a Harvard undergraduate-run think tank to develop my skills in policy research.\n\nThough I’m less certain of which year - sophomore, junior, or senior - I’ll do the following, I’m excited to cross-enroll in HKS for education policy classes such as “Program Evaluation and Education Policy” by Professor Thomas Kane, where I’d be able to study the best way to approach education from a policymaker’s perspective.

At this point, I’d also begin meeting with possible thesis advisors and applying to the Junior Deferral Program for Harvard Law School as a commitment to spending a few years in the workforce before gaining early admission to law school.\n\nDuring the summer before my senior year, I’ll be conducting fieldwork for my senior thesis on whether a quantitative (grades and rankings-driven) approach is improving or impairing the quality of American education. I’d apply to be elected either a Class Marshall or Officer to plan future class activities in the same way that I led my high school senior class and am in charge of our ten-year reunion.\n\nEven though it’ll be a very tight squeeze time-wise, all these foci are feasible within three years from sophomore to senior year - if I start now.",

Because of that, my postgraduate plans begin with pursuing entrepreneurship and education reform, then shifting to law and public policy.\n\nIn my early career, organically scaling [COMPANY] will likely be how I make the greatest impact, as startups enable widespread outreach and freedom regardless of age. Furthermore, making financial literacy more accessible is key to millions of Americans breaking out of debt or into financial freedom, and though startups are always at risk of failing, nothing great comes easy or riskless. In my junior year of college, I’d like to apply for Harvard Law school’s Junior Deferral Program (JDP). The JDP Program will allow me to spend 2 or more years pursuing my entrepreneurship propensity (by scaling [COMPANY] full-time) and allow me to spend time in the real world before law school, further enriching my law school experience.\n\nOnce [COMPANY] attains at least a million users to measurably help overcome our country's limitations regarding financial literacy, I'd turn my attention from the bank boardroom to the Supreme Courtroom and attempt to address our nation's most poignant public policy issues, such as a lack of gun control, providing accessible health care, and funding the public education system. To do so, I’d attend law school (preferably, Harvard Law School) and specialize in public interest law, pursuing my proclivity for making resources more accessible and equitable. The same way [COMPANY] aims to make financial literacy more accessible to everyday Americans, I’d make the legal system more accessible to everyday Americans.

In the same way that I served as Class President and led my school district’s leadership council to advocate for a successful change in our district’s GPA system, I’d be both honored and humbled to serve our country and create greater positive change in our nation because serving others is the one thing that makes me happiest.\n\nEntrepreneurship, education reform, and policymaking are my clear callings; allied with my mission to help those most in need, I’d like to make financial education accessible to all by scaling [COMPANY], pursuing civil rights law, being elected to public office, and passing much-needed legislation to improve equity nationally and possibly even, with a robust enough platform like that of Harvard, globally. And although global impact may still be a ways away for me, an essential modus operandi that has helped me persevere when the road ahead seems overwhelming is to “think globally, act locally”, which crystallizes both my career goals as a prospective public servant and my very reasons for seeking transfer.",

      "essay": "My mom carried me as we walked out of the cool [CITY] airport into the blazing sun. My dad promptly hailed an iconic yellow-top, black-bottom cab, and we were suddenly snaking through [CITY] sunbathed white skyscrapers, just offset from the glistening [NAME OF SEA].\n\n\n\n“Mom, I’m hungry!” a six-year-old me exclaimed.\n\n\n\nMom pulled out the last packet of Parle-G cookies and handed them to me. Tearing the packet up and placing a cookie in my mouth, I relished the crunch and sweet sugar crumbs as they melted on my tongue. Suddenly, we hit traffic. A bull was crossing the road, and while the cars made way for this holy animal to pass, the homeless of [CITY] found this an opportune moment to solicit donations from the drivers. As we sat parked on the road, a girl my age knocked on the car window.\n\n\n\n“[PHRASE IN ANOTHER LANGUAGE]”, she pleaded in [LANGUAGE].\n\n\n\nMy mom immediately grabbed the Parle-Gs out of my hand and gave them to the girl. The girl quietly thanked her and left. Sad to see my beloved cookies go, I quietly looked out the window at the street and the seashore. But my eyes were curiously drawn to the homeless lying on the side of the road, persistently requesting a morsel of food from passersby. I started to wonder what caused these people to live the way they did. In the best way I could articulate it, I turned to my mom to ask her what I felt was a simple question.\n\n\n\n“Mom, why are some people poor?”\n\n“Hmm…” she responded, thinking. “Because no one wants to give them a job”.\n\n“Why not?” I pressed further.\n\n“Because there was no opportunity for them to go to school”, she quickly replied.\n\n\n\nI sank back down in my seat. “So the girl who knocked on our window doesn’t go to school? That’s weird. Isn’t every kid supposed to go to school?”, I wondered. Given recent geopolitical events barring Afghan women from receiving an education, I’ve been reminded (with a chill) of this moment from my childhood. \n\n\n\nI find it unacceptable that even after a decade of progress in multifarious fields, every child still isn’t guaranteed an education and the opportunity to pursue a prosperous future. As I’ve witnessed the vast and virtually ubiquitous accessibility that the internet - through Zoom, Khan Academy, and even YouTube - has brought to the realm of education, I believe we have a greater responsibility today to not let children in even the most remote of places and with even the most disadvantaged of backgrounds go uneducated. The main obstacle standing in our way to achieving this is the political will to do so, but with the right degree of leverage (and the right degree), that could all change in historic fashion! Pursuing an undergraduate degree to help build a stable foundation in the world of international relations, I aim to work with leaders both at home and abroad to ensure that every child has the same educational and career-oriented opportunities, regardless of origin or socio-economic background. By this point, I’ve gone all-in on my own education, but now - with eyes as wide open as my heart - I’m ready to take my impact to the next level and go all-in on education-for-all.",

      "essay": "Despite being a Hoosier by birth, the culture shock I felt when first stepping onto American soil after nearly a decade of living in [COUNTRY] was palpable, and it didn’t take me long to realise there was much to learn before declaring myself a born-again American. My first lesson debunked my false impression that I lacked the requisite knowledge to vote when I was first eligible and occurred on bean bag chairs in a [UNIVERSITY] common room. The regrettable words catalysing this political inquisition were: “I’m probably not going to vote because…” Before I could even finish my sentence, the once laid-back atmosphere of the common room suddenly morphed into an intellectual boxing ring. And although the opposing side won, I still gained something far more valuable than the bragging rights winning such an argument could provide because I listened attentively. I learned that knowledge is definitely a part of the voting process, but only one part. The other three pieces (besides knowledge) consist of justice, courage, and temperance: the four cardinal civic virtues. So when classmates showed the courage to challenge my perspective, I took the high road to hear them out, and that has made all the difference.",

      "essay": "I tend to view the brain in the same way one would do any other muscle, and the fact that I choose to do so explains how I’ve recently gone about challenging myself intellectually. Simply put, I take my brain to the gym; I analyse its power through its capability to ‘lift’ (fully comprehend) intellectual weights of varying mass, and attempt to broaden the reach of its abilities by repeatedly pushing it just past its limits until it's capable of handling the load of even heavier weights. And, if the brain can be treated like a muscle, then it's only logical to view attending university as the process undertaken to make said muscle as strong as possible.\n\nThe desire I feel to brain-train with maximum intensity in higher education has led me to apply to Columbia – the academic equivalent of an Olympic-level gymnasium. How exactly I plan on using the resources such a ‘gym’ would offer is something I’ve spent months pondering: courses such as “Gender and Applied Economics” taught by Professor Lena Edlund, for instance, would expand my limits of intellectual agility, as would the diversity of NYC’s melting pot mentality, which closely parallels my own upbringing and education.",

What stuck with me most from the experience was coming to admire the sheer grit and unwavering perseverance of those I met during my ‘shifts’; never before had I experienced such fulfilling and uplifting interactions with complete strangers, whose gleaming personalities and senses of humour contrasted starkly with the dire nature of their socioeconomic situations. It’s from these selfsame interactions that my inspiration to study economics grew; more specifically, by my pragmatic application of knowledge regarding policy studies and poverty economics that I aspire to gain through higher education, I hope to ‘give an even bigger shift’ for the world of tomorrow.",

      "essay": "I derive pleasure from the adventure of exploring the physical capacity of my body, pulling myself out of alignment and into the discovery of new movements. The summer that I spent at the San Diego Circus Center fostered my playful mindset by providing an eclectic knowledge br and a supportive environment that allowed me to safely push the bounds of my body. Up until that summer, I had learned hand balancing through self-education, which proved frustrating due to having no real guidance to keep me on the right track. Upon arriving at the Circus Center, the sight of a muscular woman balancing in a one- armed handstand welcomed me. I instantly felt a surge of excitement rush through my body after months of patiently waiting to attend. I desired to receive professional instruction in hopes of refining my practice. Learning how to perform the individual skills properly would allow me to incorporate the movements together in improvised routines, a completely liberating experience. I take solace in this movement that serves as a type of active meditation for me because it makes me focus solely on the task at hand, quieting my mind from trivial thoughts. Additionally, my practice serves as an allegory for life, as the many lessons about my training parallel lessons about balance in my personal life.\n\nThe handstand class begun as the clock struck the hour with Jean-Luc, the owner of the Circus Center, asking me to perform my handstand for him to observe. I pulled off a thirty-second handstand, which exhausted me, for I had only intermittently practiced them. The internationally renowned hand-balancer leveled my ego quickly noting my deficiencies in the realms of flexibility, technique, and endurance, but he provided me drills to iron out my problem areas. Although I initially felt out-of-place and inferior to the other participants, I promptly regained my confidence when the other attendees went out of their way to welcome me with warm hugs. The class seemed to last way longer than one hour, as minimal rests interrupted the incessant instruction and drilling. The fact that Jean-Luc squeezed in as much information in one hour as I had learned in one year amazed me. The immense skill that I discerned at the Center as well as the friendly members made me feel at home, for I had finally stumbled upon a place that provided me with great challenge and a plan towards success.\n\nThe struggles that I faced in handstand and flexibility classes positively impacted my life. Although geographic boundaries separate me from training there regularly, I maintain the increased momentum and intensity in my training by investing two to four hours daily in yoga, rock-climbing, and bodyweight skills. I acquire new skills on a weekly basis, rapidly expanding my arsenal of bodyweight movements. The “letting go” aspect of flexibility training manifests itself in the way I approach new opportunities. Just as I let go of tension in my body to relax into deeper ranges of motion, so I too let go of anxiety in pursuing unfamiliar situations. Having been previously shy, I felt reticent towards running for a student government position decided by a popular vote, but I overcame my anxiety, met new people at my school, and eventually won student body Vice President. My determination to persevere towards my dreams of becoming a medical doctor stands at the highpoint of my life, which I directly credit to my experience at the Circus Center by furthering my passion for the human body.\n\nLooking forward, I aspire to share the stimulating information that I learned at the Circus Center with others by starting a collaborative group of movement artists. There exists an endless array of skills to learn, much more than my lifetime can accommodate, but by maintaining a mind open to continual challenge and to the knowledge of others, I will forever remain in a blissful state of movement.\n\n",

Since few schools offer the requisite skillset to run my own hotel chain nor the freedom to customize my own curriculum, my heart and mind alike alighted at the opportunity afforded by Brown to do just that: craft my own curriculum that paves an intellectual pathway to the oasis of my hospitality dreams.\n\nAs a prospective Economics concentrator on the Business Economics track, I’ll engage in courses like ECON 1730 Venture Capital, Private Equity, and Entrepreneurship to learn how to pitch VCs, calculate business valuations, and determine long-term exit strategies. In a more unfamiliar realm, courses in psychology, including CLPS 0220 Making Decisions and CLPS 0700 Social Psychology, will allow me to conquer the consumer decision-making domain and use that knowledge to implement effective brand marketing and develop positive customer relations. Moreover, to master sustainable design, ENVS 1400 Sustainable Design in the Built Environment would help me mitigate the negative environmental effects of design and construction via concepts like passive solar design, thus making me a more conscious and responsible entrepreneur. \n\nLike puzzle pieces falling into place in the Tetris game of academia, Brown’s Open Curriculum will allow me to stack my classes and skills to a level of excellence that parallels only the customer service I strive to provide in all my future hotels.",

      "essay": "As a managing editor of my school's newspaper, I’m constantly responsible for getting “the scoop” to our school body. Last year, a teacher in our school was besieged by parents in the community for assigning students a book deemed inappropriate to be taught in a high school English class. Over time, this situation escalated, which made it an increasingly appealing news story.\n\nTurning this story into an investigation, the newspaper staff decided to collaborate on this article, meeting with teachers, parents, and students for interviews, attending school board meetings, and using these insights to craft an unbiased and multi-dimensional account of the story. Upon completion, we submitted the article to be reviewed by our school’s administration before placing it in the paper to be published. \n\nTwo weeks later, we received an email from administration informing us that our article wasn’t appropriate for the school paper. Initially, it was challenging for us to understand these circumstances, especially after the tumultuous work put into the article to ensure its factuality and relevancy. However, after further communication with our school administration, we began to understand how this article was different from other ones produced, as it had the potential to spark additional controversy on a subject that’d already created divisions based on differing ideologies within our community. As a newspaper, we’ve gained sensitivity to our articles’ effects on the school body and on the community at large, and as an individual, I’ve strived to apply these same sensitivities to the world around me.",

      "essay": "Hitting against the rough concrete, my feet seemed to be moving without instruction, propelling me forward as my focus turned toward the glimmering surface of [LOCATION NAME]. Five minutes 30 seconds. The cool ocean breeze swept in from behind me, pushing me forward. Six minutes. As my attention floated back to the trail ahead of me, I pictured an imaginary finish line appearing near the end of my last mile with an uncut ribbon calling my name. Six minutes and 52 seconds: a new mile record.\n\nAs a figure skater, I’m constantly active, so this state of constant activity is second-nature to me. However, as rinks began to close down during quarantine, I had to get creative. My figure skates were replaced with running shoes, and the sheet of ice I called home was replaced with neighborhood streets, sidewalks, and running trails. Similar to Forrest Gump’s cross-country trek, I too began seeing new worlds through running - or at least slivers of them. Rain, snow, or shine, I continuously find myself racing through my neighborhood streets or, better yet, exploring new running routes outside of my own community, including one of my favorites: a path that runs adjacent to the [LOCATION NAME] shore. This exploration of new routes to run keeps my perspective fresh and my running shoes dirty, which is a new balance I wouldn’t have any other way. And while I have yet to experience the ‘runnability’ of Providence, I’m sure I’ll find my finish line at Brown. ",

      "essay": "Despite being a Hoosier by birth, the culture shock I felt when first stepping onto American soil after nearly a decade of living in [COUNTRY] was palpable, and it didn’t take me long to realise that there was a lot to learn before I could declare myself a born-again American. My first lesson debunked my false impression that I lacked the requisite knowledge to vote when I was first eligible and took place on bean bag chairs in a [UNIVERSITY] common room (not even on my own campus). The regrettable words that catalysed this political inquisition were: “I’m probably not going to vote because…” Before I could even finish my sentence, the once laid-back atmosphere of the common room suddenly morphed into an intellectual boxing ring: in one corner stood a gang of Ivy-League poli-sci students, and in the other, me. And although the opposing side was the winner by (my) decision, I still gained something far more valuable than the bragging rights winning such an argument could provide because I listened attentively to grok what the big deal was geopolitically. What I came to learn is that knowledge is definitely a part of the voting process, but only one part of a bigger whole, not unlike the vote itself. The other three pieces (besides knowledge) consist of justice, courage, and temperance: the four cardinal civic virtues. So when classmates showed the courage to challenge my perspective, I took the high road to hear them out and grew both as a person and an American because of it.",

      "essay": "Since a young age, the words ‘music’ and ‘joy’ have been one and the same to me. I feel freest with nothing but a headset and my favourite playlist, and I allow nothing to disturb the inner peace that lives in the gap between my ears and the pads of my headphones. When I take the headphones off, however, my enthusiasm for music spills out into the world around me and gives way to a much more meaningful and immersive social experience. The inspiration that music precipitates within me is contagious in the best way, as it opens doors and builds bridges between cultures. My drive to create my own music independently, to play music with other people collaboratively, and to discover the newest and most exciting artists around has not only introduced me to, but also deeply connected me with people from all walks of life, from the sticky tables adorning [CITY] underground clubs to the muddy pits of the Reading Festival. In this way, my desire to actively make use of my musicality has inadvertently led me to discovering something even more significant than music itself – the communities behind the music – and acted as a stepping stone for me to stride out of my comfort zone and embrace entire cultures which, without my headset, I would’ve otherwise never even known. And as much as I adore my dozens of saved playlists, the comradery and admiration I feel for the diverse group of fellow music-nerds with whom I share them is what makes me most proud of my musicality.",

      "essay": "Rica nu stia sa zica rau, ratusca, ramurica. I stared at the cracked ceiling of my bedroom in Romania, repeating the eight words under my breath. Rica nu stia sa zica rau, ratusca, ramurica. More than anything, I wanted to roll my r's, to speak Romanian without the telltale American accent. The simple exercise became a prayer. Rica nu stia sa zica rau, ratusca, ramurica. More than anything, I wanted to assimilate into the country that was my second home.\n\nMy problems with identity probably sound familiar to many children of immigration. I felt most at home when surrounded by Romanians. I ate mici on the Fourth of July with Romanians. I met my best friend through the Romanian community. But when I spoke Romanian, I was something else: an American. I wanted to demolish that language barrier, to jump up and down on its remains, to destroy what marked me as an imposter, a pretender, a fake.\n\nInstead, I ran away. When my parents spoke to me in Romanian, I answered in English. When my friends called me a \"fake Romanian,\" I laughed. I chose to distance myself from my culture, and I made sure everyone was aware of that choice. But beneath the surface I felt adrift in a sea of ambiguous identity. I wanted to feel at home in two cultures; instead I felt like an outsider to both.\n\nAbout two years ago, I caught the baking bug. Starting out with pre-made mixes and rock-hard chocolate chip cookies, I worked my way up to custards, traybakes, and the occasional cake. I loved the methodical, precise nature of baking and came to appreciate the chemical underpinnings that made it possible. Though I did bake for myself, I baked mostly for others, revelling in the warm nods and crumb-filled smiles as people tasted the cake I'd spent the weekend making.\n\nAs I started baking more on my own, I began leafing through old family recipes scrawled on yellowed scraps or typed up in long-forgotten emails. The aromas of cornulete, fursecuri, and saratele soon wafted through our house, evoking memories of summers long ago in our grandparent's apartments in Bucharest. The all-too-loud radio in Buni Doina's kitchen as she labored over prajituri de cirese. Plucking gogosi from the fryer with Buni's scoldings ringing in our ears. Watching Buni spoon generous amounts of honey and ground walnuts atop steaming mucenici. On some days, I imagined Buni's expert eye watching me stretch dough into clumsy figure eights, five thousand miles away.\n\nBuni's most important baking lesson, though, was not about moisture or measurements. Like me, Buni Doina can be overbearing at times, stubborn in the face of offered help, unyielding in her ways. But in the kitchen, dusted in powdered sugar, there is no denying her devotion to our happiness. Every stir of her wooden spoon is a step back to the common ground that unites us, fueled by constant, unrelenting affection. Her baking is not confined to an amalgamation of sugar, butter, and flour. It's an outstretched hand, an open invitation, a makeshift bridge thrown across the divides of age and culture.\n\nThanks to Buni, the reason I bake has evolved. What started as stress relief is now a lifeline to my heritage, a language that allows me to communicate with my family in ways my tongue cannot. By rolling dough for saratele and crushing walnuts for cornulete, my baking speaks more fluently to my Romanian heritage than my broken Romanian ever could. Making my parents the desserts of their childhood, seeing their warm, nostalgic smiles as they taste that first bite of cremsnit, I reconnect to our family and culture. Through baking, I've come to see food not simply as sustenance, but as a universal language, a way to say the unspoken and voice the impossible.",

      "essay": "I’ve always led with my heart. In kindergarten, my teacher used to recognize students for diligence or intelligence with a prize: the monthly STAR student award. One day, she picked me. Except it wasn’t for my diligence or intellect; this time, she explained that she’d picked me for exemplifying selflessness. At the time, I didn’t know what that meant. But that moment has acted as a driving force behind my identity and the core of my character ever since.\n\nBorn in the [NAME OF REGION], my parents actively pushed me towards STEM fields - a stable, lucrative path. But for as far as I can remember, I resisted because I knew I wanted to do something where I worked with people on a day-to-day basis, fighting to make the world a better place. I didn’t know what exactly that looked like, but I’d soon find my “Life’s Task”, as Robert Greene calls it.\n\nI was 7 years old the first time I watched former President Barack Obama. I felt the stirrings of something powerful whispering “this is it”. And so I announced my future profession to my parents: “Amma, Nanna, I’m going to be like Obama! I’m going to be President of the United States.”\n\nAnd it wasn’t just my parents whom I told. At school, I was reduced to tears as my STEM-inclined classmates mocked me: “You? What part of you is Presidential?” And that was when I first learned that President Obama had been the first colored President - and there had yet to be a woman in the Oval Office.\n\nWhen my parents immigrated to America, it was their promised land. At the dinner table, my parents told me how lucky I was every single day, every meal even! But they didn’t have to tell me; I already knew. Both my grandmothers had been forced to drop out of school at 11 years old, as they were married off and bearing children by the same age I started middle school.\n\nOn family trips to [COUNTRY], I was treated like a princess - and I hated it, because with that treatment came the expectation of fragility: a feeling like I was being treated as a possession, a Barbie doll, rather than a human being with ideas, with hope, and aspirations to serve not dinner, but America, and not as a housewife but as a leader.\n\nJust like it was for my parents before me, America was my promised land. It was my salvation, my freedom. It was the apple of my starry eyes as I’d pledge allegiance each morning in school.\n\nMy freedom came after generations of fighting for equality - but the fight was far from over. So, at the age of 7, I committed: to do my part in moving America towards progress, to represent and lead my people, and to be President of the United States.\n\nAnytime I’ve told someone of my aspirations, their first reaction is one of shock; the second, protection. Their initial reaction is shock because I don’t come across as “snaky” - like a “true politician” would - and their second is protection because I’ve been told I’m “too good of a person”, “not tough enough”, or “too nice“ to run for office more times than I can count.\n\nComing full circle, what I was lauded for at five-years-old - selflessness - is now the very thing that supposedly disqualifies me from the political path. And it is my life’s mission to change that perception. It is my firmest belief that leaders should come in all colors and genders, but they should all share one commonality: a love for service.",

      "prompt": "In this second essay, please discuss your academic goals and intellectual interests. Are there topics that you would like to deeply explore during your undergraduate years? Please reflect upon what you hope to gain from a liberal arts and sciences education. ",
      "essay": "In my undergraduate years, I’m acutely driven to deeply explore the solutions regarding the reformation of the education system and ensuring that parental socio-economic status is no longer a primary - or worse, solitary - determinant of later financial or mental well-being. I first explored this interest by working intimately in the education sector during my high school years, which is when I: 1. advocated for increased funding to be allocated to [STATE] public education, 2. worked alongside my school district on student empowerment and equity, and 3. self-published the Amazon bestselling book [TITLE OF BOOK]. The reason I went to such great lengths to advocate for increased educational access and empowerment is because I believe in a world in which the American Dream is made increasingly attainable with improvements in our education system, and I’d like to immerse myself further in the research regarding this sector because making education more accessible makes the American Dream more accessible and thus, by day’s end, that much more worth fighting for. \n\nI’m also fascinated with the growing uses of AI in the public sector, particularly pertaining to education. AI advances will enable technology to supplement education, and I am excited to work on projects that use AI to create personalized tutors for students in public education. Much like AI connects the dots through supervised learning - learning from inputs from the past - history is the ultimate game of knowledge, where patterns continue repeating unless someone becomes aware of them. For that reason, I’m enthralled by history, and especially history through the lens of political science (changes to power dynamics throughout history). It was only during my college history class that I learned that Africans weren’t a monolithic people who enslaved their own kind (which was the narrative presented in [STATE] high school history classes) and learned more deeply about the injustices perpetrated on the indigenous peoples of America. Putting together bits and pieces of the past continuously challenges my current ways of thinking - and I find that process thrilling! Learning about the power structures that have enabled structural violence and the fearless revolutionaries who have fought for equality burns a fire in my veins - a fire that ensures I continue their work in the future. And piecing together the past to extrapolate that future is certainly ambiguous territory, but it’s the ultimate puzzle I aim to solve.",

As we walked onto the train, my eye glanced over at the map on the timetable posted. I loved the sense of security that came with knowing the precise position of each station on the way to NY Penn Station, cementing maps and their study - cartography - as calming complementary forces in my life since adolescence. \n\nBut as I grew older, maps took on a different meaning. I developed a fascination for the flow of history and how tiny battles or policy decisions could change how our world might’ve looked today. I could open my atlas and imagine how a united Western Europe would look on the map if Louis the Pious hadn’t divided the Carolingian Empire, or look at a map of the hinterlands of Kenya and wonder if the land was fertile enough to facilitate the growth of a major civilization. These explorations into my maps have given me a historical playground where my imagination can reign supreme, providing an outlet to explore the vast unknowns that continue to captivate my curiosity.",

Over dinner, my family discussed how the situation paralleled our ancestors’ slave-like existence under the British Raj. “Israel’s occupying Palestinian land, just like the British did with us. They should leave!”, my dad pointedly exclaimed. I felt sympathy for the Palestinians and very quickly felt a conviction for their cause against Israeli occupation. The next day in [COURSE], I debated anyone who opposed me, citing how Israel was younger than my grandparents while the Palestinians had been living in the area for about 1,000 years. Since nobody opposed my arguments, I felt morally justified in my conviction.\n\nYet at that moment, my [COURSE] teacher turned her quiet yet powerful wit toward our debate: “By that logic, shouldn’t Americans move off land that was stolen from Native Americans?” My strong conviction now wavering, I stuttered in search of an argument, but nothing I said had any punch anymore. I had to finally accept that I knew less about the topic than I claimed I did.

But despite his difficulties, my Tata still came with me to the beach, snuggled with little 2-, 3-, and 4-year-old me in bed, and let me prank him by playing with his eyelids as he napped. When he passed away, my mom tried to fill the void by reading stories of a character named Critter spending the day in the city with his own grandfather, reminding me that Tata would’ve spent the day with me in the same way. But for me, it still wasn’t the same. I felt nothing could replace the warm and sagacious presence he’d had in my life.\n\nFive years later, my mom took me to an event held by [NAME OF SENIOR CENTER], a senior center serving elderly [ETHNICITY]. The minute I walked through the door, I immediately felt a cozy energy oozing through the atmosphere. [LANGUAGE] and [LANGUAGE] words warmed my ears as I noticed women giggling and men in the throes of deep conversation.

Between serving meals, I’d sit down with [NAME] aunty, ask her about her grandson, and be delighted when she exclaimed he’d won his school’s spelling bee. When I had a doubt about a career I wanted to pursue, [NAME] uncle would calm me down, reminding me that as long as I focused on one field, I’d find my own success. And to honor the [RELIGION] goddess [NAME], the seniors didn’t hesitate to rope me into their [NAME OF DANCE], gleefully clinking their dandiyas (sticks) with mine as we twirled across the dance floor. As I’ve grown with them, the warmth and care the seniors have shown me have made me value their wisdom, and learn to celebrate joy as they do. As I’ve felt their exuberance and support, I’m continuously reminded that my Tata’s love and wisdom never entirely escaped from me at all.",

      "essay": "The sound of the ocean at night is my favourite part of [CITY]. Every year, we traveled less to see our family, and whenever I was there, I’d feel like an outsider having lost an essential part of my identity. \n\nOne summer night when I was staying with my grandmother in the north, my friend [NAME] asked me on the phone late at night if I’d really live there. I was out on the balcony so as not to disturb anyone with my conversation, and, hearing waves lightly lap the shore in the background, I told him a part of me really wanted to. He couldn’t understand why. I wanted to show him then: the beauty hidden in the north.\n\nAnd later that year, I did! Several friends, [NAME], and I participated in a service trip held by our school, and we went to the north. We were received by a school and went daily for a week to build stairs on what’d become a dump. We talked over lunch each day with the neighbors, a single mother, and her son, who was always smiling and following us around. \n\nWe cleaned the dump first, collecting everything from oxidized metals to feces. Then, we fragmented the rocks under the hill to make the land more easily workable and excavated holes for the stairs, filling them with the rock fragments and putting wood on top. We then built benches, a roof, and planted trees at the bottom of the hill to rejuvenate the area.\n\nBefore the stairs were finished, we went one afternoon after work to the sea where [NAME] and I played soccer and made friends with a stray dog we called [NAME]. Afterward, I told him I missed the ocean, the stray dogs, and the colloquialisms that I slowly outgrew over the years. He told me he could now understand why I missed it. \n\n[COUNTRY] is my community, from north to south. It’s shaped me as a person and has placed very special people in my life. By building the stairs and a playground plus fixing houses, I was able to help and give something back to the area that raised me. I wish to go back someday - not just to hear the ocean - but to see children use the playground and people walk down the stairs to the safety of their homes we’d recently renovated and reinforced. ",

      "essay": "In Octavia E. Butler’s “Parable of the Talents”, she writes that “God is change”. She also writes: “Ask Questions. Seek answers. Learn. Teach”. My sister suffers from a chromosomal deletion, and I’ve witnessed the consequences of standardized teaching methods, which is why those last two words - “Learn. Teach.” - resonate so deeply with me.\n\nUs humans have evolved, and we change constantly during our lifetime. We change in every way imaginable from physically to psychologically. For example, our brains hold information on neuroplasticity, disabilities, education, and ways to make the latter more accessible. \n\nWe keep discovering new approaches to improve the effectiveness of teaching and studying, so I’m particularly drawn to study disabilities and ways science can help schools and society better education.\n\nWitnessing multifarious therapies, methodologies, and schools of thought enter the picture to help my sister opened my eyes to the possibilities of all the extant educational permutations combining curricula with cutting-edge technology that could benefit greater society, not to mention my little sister, who, like many in our community, dreams at 12 of being able to read and write. By recalling Butler’s words “Learn. Teach.” and applying them to our community, we can make these dreams come true.",

      "essay": "Political science is the academic area that piques my curiosity most, especially with the history of how past power structures shape inequality today. I’m fascinated with the intersection and apparent contradictions of the egalitarian ideals upon which America was built; in the same decade that the Declaration of Independence was written, declaring all men equal, Native Americans were treated as brutes and black indentured servants were shackled into servitude. Most of all, I’m intensely curious to learn about the lives of the invisible; currently, I’m reading A Black Woman’s History of the United States, which chronicles black women’s experiences at a time when both legal and societal systems disenfranchised them completely. At Princeton, I’d like to continue this civil rights-based political science work by conducting research with Professor Tali Mendelberg, who focuses on the institutional nuances that invisibly prevent women from holding positions of power. This research is especially important to me because I’ll be running for political office one day and am dedicated to electing more women to political office as a volunteer with [NAME OF ORGANIZATION] and She [NAME OF ORGANIZATION], organizations that support electing young progressive women to political power.\n\nExtracurricularly, I spend my time trying to solve America’s problems through entrepreneurship. Last year, I co-founded [COMPANY], a startup working to make financial literacy available to all Americans. At Princeton, I’d immerse in the eLab startup incubator, the entrepreneurship minor’s workshops, and the Princeton Startup Immersion Program to further explore my entrepreneurial interests and scale [COMPANY].",

Doing this is my way of giving back; my heritage is one that’s been silenced by colonization, and my grandparents grew up in a developing nation, so my family has fought through unimaginable adversity to foster the voices of the next generation (like mine), which makes me hyper-aware of my responsibility to pay my knowledge and blessings forward unto others.",

      "essay": "If there’s one phrase I’m intimately familiar with, it’s: “That’s not for you!”\n\nWant to enter politics? “No, don’t risk it,” my mom cautions ad infinitum. “Get a tech job. It pays well.”\n\nWant to run for office? “It’s not for us,” strangers posit. “Politics is for the rich.”\n\nUpon discovering I wanted to be like then-President Obama and telling my 8-year-old classmates I’d be running for President, they chortled: “You?! Have you ever seen anyone like you become President?” Those around me laughed, yet with tears streaming down my face, I murmured: “It’s okay if you don’t believe it now. I’ll be the first of my kind, if I have to.”\n\nI’ve had numerous conversations with a plethora of people who don’t believe I should enter politics. Why? It’s too hard, too risky, it’s “not for me”. Though I used to ask the world “Why?” I’ve since stopped because I’ve discovered my own “Why”. Every one of those conversations reflects contemporary reality - a reality in which women are politically underrepresented. Yet, I assert that in subsequent decades, policy and reality will shift and more women will hold office. In the meantime, when someone tells me it’s not my place to run for office, I smile and nod - and continue on my path. Every “don’t” makes my work more worthwhile.\n\nBecause if politics is “not for me”, then who is it for? I’ll show who it’s for by running no matter how many times I’m told it’s “not for me”.",

      "essay": "“Ice cream Fridays!” “Two hours of recess!” 500 middle schoolers stood and cheered, pounding their feet on the bleachers. Declan was the popular star quarterback and my opponent for school president. He looked like an adult in a tailored suit, gesturing with his hands, never checking his notes, casting looks at the girls sitting in the front row. He had long wavy hair, a smooth complexion, and charisma. I sat in my polyester blue blazer and rumpled khakis. I was becoming more emasculated and filled with self-doubt with each chant.\n\nI had the best platform ideas and my aunt helped paint two dozen campaign posters. The year before, I carried the weight in student council while Declan skipped half our meetings. I was sure I could win. I clomped to the mic in my dad’s dress shoes. I read my long speech from my notes without enthusiasm. My only applause came from a couple of friends who felt bad for me.\n\nLater, in high school, math and programming made sense to me — people didn’t. At a Model UN meeting, confident upperclassmen talked about the power of persuasion and public speaking. I felt like I didn’t belong, but their command of the stage made me want to be a part of it. At my first conference, representing Brazil’s humanitarian policies, I had developed what I thought was a brilliant proposal. I was confident and was the first to raise my placard. I had so many ideas but when I took the mic, I didn’t know where to start. I rambled on about background and never got to my main points. I felt foolish for thinking I was going to be so effective. My highwater pants and my sleeves hanging over my fingers added to my insecurity.\n\nI continued this pattern of my speaking skills not matching my confidence in the quality of my ideas. To compensate, I increased the intensity of my preparation. I’d fill a binder with hundreds of research documents, I immersed myself in my roles. I mistakenly assumed that good ideas alone would be enough to win. At one conference, two delegates asked me to join their bloc to get access to my ideas with no intention of giving me a meaningful role. They saw me purely as a policy wonk.\n\nMy fascination with geopolitical and economic issues were what kept me committed to MUN. But by the end of sophomore year, the co-presidents were fed up. “Henry, we know how hard you try, but there are only so many spots for each conference...” said one. “You’re wasting space, you should quit,” said the other.\n\nNevertheless, I persisted. My junior year I ran for club secretary. Automating attendance and quantitative projects were my inclination. But members saw me as a younger, less intimidating officer, and started coming to me for guidance. When Gabby, a freshman, came to me for advice, I tried to pass her off to the co-presidents. She was terrified of speaking at conferences, and I didn’t know how to express my empathy. “They aren’t going to take me seriously, I don’t have charisma, I’m too short!” I saw my own insecurities in her. I didn’t feel like I was qualified to help, but I reminded her of the passion she had shown in meetings. Gradually, I became a mentor to her and many others. I was enjoying supporting them and was gratified by guiding their growth as delegates. One sophomore even anointed me “MUN soccer mom.”\n\nOn the bus to her first conference, Gabby was in a panic, but throughout the day I saw her confidence grow. When she won Outstanding Delegate, beyond anyone’s expectations, our whole row erupted in wild cheers. When my name was also called shortly after, it felt anticlimactic. I was far more proud of succeeding in my new role as a mentor than I was of my own award.",

Last year, a teacher in our school was besieged by parents in the community for assigning students a book deemed inappropriate to be taught in a high school English class. Over time, this situation escalated, which made it an increasingly appealing news story.\n\nTurning this story into an investigation, the newspaper staff decided to collaborate on this article, meeting with teachers, parents, and students for interviews, attending school board meetings, and using these insights to craft an unbiased and multi-dimensional account of the story. Upon completion, we submitted the article to be reviewed by our school’s administration before placing it in the paper to be published. \n\nTwo weeks later, we received an email from administration informing us that our article wasn’t appropriate for the school paper. Initially, it was challenging for us to understand these circumstances, especially after the tumultuous work put into the article to ensure its factuality and relevancy. However, after further communication with our school administration, we began to understand how this article was different from other ones produced, as it had the potential to spark additional controversy on a subject that’d already created divisions based on differing ideologies within our community. As a newspaper, we’ve gained sensitivity to our articles’ effects on the school body and on the community at large, and as an individual, I’ve strived to apply these same sensitivities to the world around me.",

Kahn inspired me to dive deeper within the realm of business, prompting me to explore the relationship between brands and their consumers. My dad noticed my particular propensity and work ethic for business when it came to “homework” he’d assign me from his [CITY] office and from around our “home office”, which eventually impelled him to provide me with an apprenticeship role in his business. As I gradually became more accustomed to the arrays of number-filled spreadsheets piled atop desks and business jargon commonly used around the office, I could feel the entrepreneurial bug within me metamorphosing into a business-oriented butterfly. I was almost ready…\n\nAs a high school student, I was finally able to spread my metaphorical metamorphosed wings at the opportunity to join DECA since I’d yearned to become more embroiled in the encapsulating realm of entrepreneurship for some time by freshman year. From there, I began my journey of constructing, presenting, and defending business proposals with a focus on franchise expansion and a desire to understand the various meticulous operations necessary for the establishment and growth of a business venture. As a freshman, I was daunted by the task of producing a business proposal that would cover all aspects of a business, including preparing financial statements. However, I soon found myself thriving by taking on the role of a potential franchisee, working on each section of my business proposal separately and putting them together to watch my business grow on paper, like puzzle pieces fitting into place. After my second year in this role, I was prompted to advance my entrepreneurial aspirations by taking on a marketing course at Cornell. Through [COURSE NAME], I committed myself to comprehending topics like consumer decision-making and enhancing brand equity by relating topics to real-world situations and back to what I’d learned in The Shopping Revolution, which I then brought back into my DECA chapter to implement in my own proposals and pass on to other members and officers. \n\nThis past summer, my zest for entrepreneurship brought me to the [NAME OF DISTRICT] in [CITY] where I interned interdepartmentally at the [NAME OF HOTEL CHAIN]. I not only immersed myself in the environment as it pertained to the hotel, but also experienced first-hand the role that the hotel played in the community at large: hosting events and organizing promotions involving multifarious businesses and organizations across the [DISTRICT]. From working on social media promotion to shadowing website development to organizing a puppy adoption event in the hotel, I nurtured my entrepreneurial bug while expanding my business horizons, leading me to develop the realization that the hospitality industry is where my business-oriented butterfly-self thrives. \n\nBefore diving headfirst into the proverbial shark tank, I seek to utilize the multitudinous opportunities at the Cornell Hotel School that pertain to leadership and innovation within the hospitality industry. Hotelie Entrepreneurs (HE) and Hotelies Serving Society (HS2) will allow me to further develop my entrepreneurial hospitality aspirations through engaging with both industry-leading entrepreneurs and the Ithaca community. I also plan to stack my schedule with courses like Business Model Innovation and Design while engaging simultaneously in the Hotel Leadership Development Program, all in alignment with my overarching career goal of becoming a successful entrepreneurial hotelie.",

      "prompt": "Cornell: Students in Arts and Sciences embrace the opportunity to delve into multifaceted academic interests, embodying in 21st century terms Ezra Cornell’s “any person…any study” founding vision. Tell us about the areas of study you are excited to explore, and specifically why you wish to pursue them in our College.* ",
      "essay": "It was a warm and sunny summer day as I made my way across the bustling Thurston Avenue Bridge towards the Martin Y. Tang Welcome Center. I stopped for a moment to gaze at the nearby Triphammer Falls, and I heard the marching band as they walked past. Throughout my campus tour, I was impressed with all the opportunities the College of Arts & Sciences can offer, and I was stunned by Cornell’s beautiful campus. Overall, Cornell will provide me with the resources and opportunities to pursue my interest in science.\n\nIn recent years, I have heard of more bizarre weather events as a result of climate change and global warming, such as snowstorms in Texas, wildfires in California, and more severe hurricanes. I have always been invested in our planet and environment; observing these events, my interest has peaked with learning about several smaller issues that may contribute to climate change overall, as well as potential solutions or alternatives. For instance, I have recently become fascinated by the negative impact of carbon emissions from cars. Drawing from my previous experiences in other countries such as China and Italy, I have investigated alternate modes of transportation such as buses or high-speed rail, which could reduce the amount of cars on the road and therefore the amount of emissions per person.\n\nHowever, while researching these topics, I have become aware that not everyone has equal access to these solutions or alternatives due to various factors and aspects of one’s life. For example, some areas may not have many developed alternatives to driving a car, and not everyone can afford access to cleaner energy sources or products made of more environmentally friendly materials. Additionally, some people may be restricted in living and housing options, whether due to circumstance or by policy, and these people could be more negatively affected by natural disasters that arise as a result of climate change. \n\nThese issues are all extremely relevant today and I feel obligated to help find solutions to them in the future. To solve these environmental and social issues, I was not only drawn towards the natural sciences but also the humanities and social sciences. The College of Arts & Sciences’ commitment to a liberal arts education would allow me to explore all of my academic passions while taking part in interdisciplinary studies, gaining new perspectives from peers that have various academic interests and come from many different backgrounds, while learning how I can apply my knowledge to solve crucial problems. Courses in the Environment and Sustainability program such as ENVS 4443 Global Climate Science and Policy and ENVS 4444 Climate Smart Communities: State and Local Climate Change Science, could lend me the chance to learn and discuss many issues that are relevant at this moment, particularly climate change and global warming, as well as potential solutions to these problems.\n\nOther than environmental science, I am also invested in several other science-related subjects such as physics and biology, allowing me to learn the fundamental concepts of how the world works. The College of Arts & Sciences’ Biological Physics program is particularly intriguing, as it offers interdisciplinary flexibility, allowing me to study physics and biology simultaneously while exploring possible ways to apply my newfound knowledge to solve environmental issues. Additionally, the college  provides research opportunities around the nation and the world, and I could dive deeper into specific subjects by participating in research programs such as Professor Michelle Wang’s LASSP’s Single Molecule Biophysics Lab.\n\nWith additional interdisciplinary programs in the College of Arts & Sciences, I could gain knowledge on a variety of topics and then apply it to help others and the environment. The myriad of academic programs, resources, and opportunities that the Cornell College of Arts & Sciences offers would be a valuable component in my college pursuits.",

      "essay": "As the sun emerges from behind the mountains, my grandfather and I remain fixated on the onigiri atop the dining table. We aren’t engrossed in the onigiri, per se, but rather their wrappers–the canvas where we sketch gadget designs.\n\nGrandpa inspires me to follow his footsteps by designing contraptions to benefit humanity. We both place a large emphasis on the importance of transportation to the environment’s well-being. His patent for a [PRODUCT] was the biggest project I’ve contributed to. Consequently, I aspire to work with Dr. Francis M. Vanek, whose research interests involve the environmental impact of transportation systems. I imagine working together on a shared passion, alternative energy-powered cars (and maybe even convincing my family to buy them in the process).\n\nCornell’s engineering program places a significant emphasis on building a conscious future. Understanding the intricacies of societies and the demands of global warming is a key component of becoming an environmental engineer. Professor Zinda’s Environmental Sociology course educates students to engineer solutions with an astute understanding of the communities involved, not just knowledge of principles. When reflecting on two communities I’ve experienced intimately–[COUNTRY] and [STATE]–I understand the nuanced scenarios brought upon by different environmental concerns. I always seek to be sensitive and aware in my approach to projects.\n\nMy grandfather’s humanitarian mindset defines my own engineering process. Learning from Cornell faculty with aligned ideologies would be a dream come true. At Cornell, I believe I can carry on my grandfather’s legacy with a holistic engineering viewpoint. ",

Ever since that class, you’ve been there to uplift me when I was down, push me when I could do more, and share your personal struggles as a student, teenager, actor, and husband. No teacher has had such a warm, outgoing, and confident impact on the person I am today. Thank you for everything.\n\nLove,\n[NAME]",

What if all you needed to do was open up your laptop and immerse yourself in the experience? These questions launched my hobbies of coding, 3D modeling, and creating virtual ski experiences.\n\nThe first challenge I faced was loading geographical terrain into the modeling software. After extensive research, I realized I needed to use heightmaps, a grayscale image representing the various heights of a specific region. Rendering a full-scale mountain would have consumed a significant amount of memory, making the game unplayable. To optimize the terrain, I set up ratios to calculate new widths and heights, which required less memory while retaining the original quality.\n\nMimicking skiing was another challenge. Gravity, in my game, pulled skis straight down the slopes, regardless of the direction the skis were facing. To create the look and feel of turns, I consulted my physics teacher on the mechanics. Together, we determined that there needed to be a force perpendicular to the gravitational pull that would cause the skis to move in the direction they faced.  \n\nModeling my very own ski resort and coding functional skis reinforced my passion for problem solving. I enjoyed the challenges my questions posed. I had to teach myself new ways to code and new ways to think about solving problems. Time to go skiing—even if I am not on the slopes.",

I can see what both are in their simplest manner during that moment of a symphony orchestra when all the instruments are listening to how the trumpet plays a note, and the piano answers each time. Someone plays, someone else answers, all throughout the song. It’s a conversation, in which they acknowledge each other's presence, thus giving each other life.\n\nThe music becomes more alive than anything around. It feels more alive than I do at the moment, and my life is broken down in notes of simple emotions, as people tend to process feelings sonically. I see the strangers beside me and know that they too are seeing their life reflected, not by specific experiences unique to themselves, but by raw emotions known to everyone. I then understand the strangers and know that, even if deceased, the composer understood us too.\n\nI shed tears everytime I listen to an orchestral arrangement. They aren’t made of happiness or sadness, but of a wave of many feelings that flow incessantly as the water in which they come. And I love it. It’s as if the songs - filled with nostalgia and beauty - allow me to wrap myself in them and come out with nothing but calmness and clarity. In musical pieces, I know that the worst and best feelings one could experience can coexist harmoniously, and I maintain hope that we can live amongst our own feelings in that same harmony.",

      "essay": "“How do you keep going after days like this?” a tear-stricken woman asked me after watching me put all my effort into attempting to resuscitate her husband after he had committed suicide. I‘ve grappled with my answer to her question for many years, but I may finally have one.\n\nI wish I could truthfully say that I have grown accustomed to the catastrophic calls. I wish I could say the weight of the words “I’m sorry for your loss” lessens after saying them countless times to heartbroken families. But that is not the reality.\n\n“Days like this” come often in emergency medicine; people call 911 on the worst day of their lives, when their baby stops breathing or their loved one suddenly collapses. Being one of the youngest medical responders ever certified in [Location], I have spent the majority of my adolescence running toward car crashes, flaming buildings, and into ditches while most sane people bolt in the opposite direction. While I am no stranger to cardiac arrest, severed limbs, and failing organs, it isn’t the mutilated patients that stand out in my memory, but the moments when I get a pulse back during CPR, the hugs from grateful family members, and the few, but treasured “thank you’s.”\n\nThis steel box that flies down the road at seventy miles per hour is where I grew up, where I fell in love with emergency medicine. It was a whole new world of insatiable curiosity and gut-wrenching adrenaline; where I became fascinated by the actions of presents a new puzzle—a new person to heal.\n\nI never knew I had the courage to talk a suicidal sixteen-year-old boy down from the edge of a bridge, knowing that he could jump and take his life at any moment.\n\nI never knew I had the strength to hold the hand of a dying man encased in the wreckage of his car while he spoke his last words to me.\n\nI never knew I had the confidence to stand my ground and defend my treatment plan to those who saw me as less than capable because of my age or gender.\n\nThe emergency services brought me to places that I never could have imagined and introduced me to patients and people who broadened my worldview. I found myself in frigid rivers pulling unresponsive people into boats and laughing at the incredible sense of humor of a homeless man. It didn’t matter where people came from or who they were when they were on my stretcher, socioeconomic status and labels fell away. Whether I was performing CPR or helping a frail old woman off her kitchen floor, I knew I was changing a stranger’s life even if all I could offer was a hand to hold.\n\nI have an innate passion to heal. I am continuously enthralled by the complexity and endless beauty of the human body and I could spend my whole life studying it, but I will only scrape the surface of its wonders. I could engineer cells to produce missing proteins; I could grow stem cell hearts, livers, and kidneys; I could create tumor destroying medications; I can heal people one person at a time until I help eliminate the word ‘incurable’ from the dictionary. I answer that catastrophic call day after day because to love medicine is to love humanity and no one has ever really lived until they have done something for someone who can never repay them.",

In my peripheral vision, I spy a judge wincing at the noise. I dry my sweaty palms on my slacks and visualize the first measure of my piece. I position my fingers on the keys who normally feel so familiar, though today, like strangers. My breath syncopates in my chest as my heart beats presto staccato. With time ticking away, the moment never quite right, I attack the first note.\n\nSince age 5, I’ve been learning the technique of playing, listening to, and analyzing the history of piano and music. Practicing requires diligence and dedication, but for me it’s become as automatic as brushing my teeth. While listening to music, even on the radio, I’ve been trained to listen for rhythm, textures, tempo, patterns, and historical context. Ensemble play, which I’ve been doing since age 7, has helped develop my leadership skills, my openness to different opinions and ideas, and of course patience. I use these skills daily in school and sports, as they help me collaborate better. \n\nPlaying piano is like traveling on an infinite roadway toward mastery. Though you may never arrive, the journey is what counts. For me, piano is a metaphor for what it takes to succeed in life: hard work, persistence, and courage. After 14 years of courageous performance, there’s one thing I can always count on: the next note.",

      "essay": "Lying on my stomach, I hang over the edge of the dock and scrape barnacles from its pylons. The little crustaceans pop off and splash into the still lagoon. The water gets cloudy where the barnacles fall; the grazing fish begin to show interest. A silver flash catches my eye, triggering me to cast a mud-crab-baited line. I get a little jolt of adrenaline when a fish thumps my line. With an experienced touch, I give a tug and set the hook. My reel starts to scream as the lunker takes line. We play tug-of-war until he tires, signaling it's time to reel him in. I wrangle the sheepshead into my net, and its buck-toothed smile makes me laugh. I jot down his length and weight and take a picture of him before gently releasing him back into the water - onto the next fish.\n\nI delight in tracking and observing marine life. I document where and when I catch fish, air and water temperature, species, weight, and length. I’ve learned that fish adhere to specific patterns. When I first started tracking fish, it was purely because I loved fishing. However, over the years my interest in the marine environment has blossomed. I got my Open Water PADI certification to explore the underwater environment. This past summer, I partook in a project involving dumping and tracking over 76,000 clams into our bays to help our clam population. Next summer, I aim to spearhead similar initiatives at [MARINE CENTER]",

      "essay": "Dear fellow Cardinal,\n\nRecently, I took a personality test as part of an internship and the introspective insight therein made me realize the world is composed of two main groups of people:  the Leland’s and the Jane’s. Based on Leland Stanford’s demeanor, the Leland’s are considered more flexible, laid-back, patient, and creative while the Jane’s of the world - like Jane Stanford - are typically more competitive, impatient, fast-paced, and achievement-oriented. Both groups have great qualities, so I’d be curious to see how you’d identify. In case you’re curious about my test results, they’re in! I’m a Jane, and here’s why…\n\nAccording to the assessment, I’m a high energy person. That means if you suggest seeing the Stanford Symphony Orchestra, going to the gym, or tossing some pigskin, I’m in. It may take me a while to pick an IntroSem or pizza toppings because I’m what the assessment calls a “thoughtful decision maker.” As a bit of an introvert, I enjoy hanging out with friends, usually in smaller groups. Finally, I relish adventure, so spearfishing tops my list of activities to try.\n\nSpeaking of trying new activities, do you like trying new things? They say opposites attract, so even if you’re completely different from me, I’m confident we’ll become fast friends fishing for fun new pastimes in our warm new home. So, what do you think: are you a Jane like me, or perhaps a Leland like some of my best friends from high school? \n\nCan’t wait to find out,\n[NAME]",

Upon returning to [COUNTRY #2], I found myself with much free time, so I started spending it doing activities I enjoyed like: drawing, mathematics, reading, music, writing, cooking, and traveling.\n\nI kept learning [LANGUAGE] and started drawing daily while improving my gouache and digital art. I began reading more and managed to finish more books weekly than usual (2-3 instead of 1). \n\nOne of the books I opened often was the “Calculus” book by James Stewart that I used throughout my Mathematics lessons, as I also tutored people for different university admission tests in the Mathematics sections, PAES (Chile), and SAT. While tutoring, I found one person used to get easily frustrated upon persistently misunderstanding concepts, so after class, I spoke with her about her disdain for mathematics. After 30 minutes, we discovered the source of her frustration wasn’t Mathematics itself; it was her anemic mathematical foundation due to changing schools when younger. Subsequently, we decided to step back and return to the basics (multiplication tables, adding, etc). Like this, we slowly ameliorated her foundation, and I learned to express my mathematical logic multi-dimensionally.\n\nI also kept expressing myself creatively by spending more time on music and songwriting. I wrote one of my favourites about living life as fervently as tango. I also picked up my violin and harmonica again, instruments I’d long neglected, and started writing short stories. \n\nI’m vegetarian, so even though gastronomy isn’t something I’m particularly interested in, I’m always cooking and trying new recipes. When I returned from [COUNTRY #1], I started integrating new flavours and trying to find replacements for the products I couldn’t find where I live. That last one led to an annoyed family staring at me wondering why I used soy sauce in everything I cooked now. And my newfound culinary seaweed use led to a long hunt of trying to find a place to leave it where my mother couldn’t smell it; for that, we give endless praise to Ziploc and the cabinet outside the house! \n\nI also had the opportunity to accompany my father on a business trip, and travelled to Europe (France, Hungary, Ireland, and the UK). On that trip, I visited universities and attended my first class of Mathematics on campus during Open Day, a microcosm of a dream come true.",

Besides learning to dance, I discovered how complete salsa can feel when dancing to it.

With more practice, I eventually learned to spin (with ease, even!) and mix multiple steps and movements comfortably alongside the music such that it felt like riding a bike.",

      "essay": "Each year since Pre-kinder, there was a day I had to stand up beside my classmates to make a tunnel, because the entire school had to make a path for the last walk out of school for the 12th grade students, and, at the end, parents threw white balloons into the air. The day I went out for the last time, however, I walked alone and instead of white balloons in the summer sky, I witnessed winter’s niveous white clouds.\n\nIn 12th grade, I knew I had most of the prerequisites to graduate early, so I decided to maintain my grades and attendance to be able to actually do it. I faced some complications with the attendance part, since not going to school for Covid prevention was no longer justified, and I also got my wisdom teeth pulled, causing me to miss a week of school and have to contact, alongside my school, the Ministry of Education to submit the medical certificate of my absence.\n\nThe reason I had my wisdom teeth pulled on a school week was to travel to [CITY]. A couple years ago, I’d started reading [AUTHOR’S NAME] and fell in love with his unfamiliar style of writing and storytelling, so I quickly started reading more [LANGUAGE] literature and soon discovered [COUNTRY] rich history, which made me decide to learn the language. I love languages, and [LANGUAGE] caught my attention for both its phonetic beauty and its differences from English and other romantic languages. Given [COUNTRY] national technological and engineering prowess, learning [LANGUAGE] may even facilitate future opportunities in my intended area(s) of study.\n\nThat’s why, when the idea of graduating early became a reality, I’d decided to live in [COUNTRY] for three months and attend a language school. In order to do this, I had to get a student visa, for which I had to apply through a school. After investigating, I found a language school that could apply for my visa, so I completed legal forms alongside my parents and in 2 months got a positive response. I finished school the last week of June and left for [CITY] the first week of July. I’d always envisioned as a kid how my life would look in my senior year, but little did I know that instead of walking out of school with my friends under white balloons, I’d be walking under [CITY] city lights.

      "essay": "I have as much stage presence as a four-year-old singing the ABCs in front of his parents. But as a child, enthralled by the talents of the young performers on my television screen, I consumed all the media the entertainment industry offered. Whether I was watching dramas, musicals, or comedies, the diversity of life journeys represented by each character inspired me, and I hoped to discover my unique path. However, I began to notice the lack of black talent for leading roles in productions that didn't contain all- black casts. If mainstream media only highlighted the stories of white people, would black people get to control the narrative? Were black people inferior to white people? If so, would I never achieve an equal amount of success as my white counterparts? I wondered if I'd ever overcome the feeling of unworthiness that continued to overwhelm me.\n\nAs a five-year-old, I saw the movie \"Cinderella,\" starring Brandy Norwood and Whitney Houston, two singers I admire. Both Houston, working behind the scenes as a producer, and Norwood as the titular character amazed me. Norwood held her own amongst established white actors, and I saw, for the first time, the result of allowing black people to express their talents without hindrance. Inspired by Brandy Norwood, I vowed to take charge of my life and embody a passion for excellence. But fulfilling my self- proclaimed values came with obstacles that I hadn't anticipated.\n\nI developed a love of learning that allowed me to succeed academically, which made me feel as if I was exemplifying the spirit of Brandy Norwood as I had intended, in a way that was unique to my skill set. Yet, several questions plagued my everyday thoughts. Was I content with the amount of effort it took to obtain my desired level of accomplishment? Or was I trying to prove my worth within the confines of predominantly white spaces? Worse, was I actively trying to dissociate from a stereotype that portrays black people as unintelligent? My mind lacked a sense of clarity because I didn't understand why my success wasn't enough to provide me with the satisfaction I craved.\n\nRe-watching \"Cinderella\" when I was older made me realize that I've always wanted to be a star in my own life, but I've never wanted to be the only star. I appreciated Brandy Norwood for standing out in an industry that often disadvantages black creatives, but I did not want to be the princess that she was. I wanted to be Whitney Houston, who recognized the star within Brandy Norwood and facilitated her career growth. From then on, I've felt that my life has a sense of purpose. I know that using my influence to provide more opportunities for people of color to prosper fulfills me. I've been able to further my purpose on a small scale by implementing ethnic diversity in my digital illustrations to allow children to feel represented in a way that the media rarely afforded me. But I have even bigger goals.\n\nFor years, many within the African diaspora have stigmatized mental health awareness, often belittling those who seek help for mental illnesses. If I had the wand of Cinderella's fairy godmother, I would use it to eradicate my community's struggles with mental health. Instead, I plan to become a psychiatrist to promote mental health as a desirable aspect of self-care and make it a more economically feasible option for low-income families.\n\nWhether I'm participating in mental health organizations on campus or conducting research to gain further insight into the minds of the members of my community who reject maintaining mental wellness, I desire to embody the spirit of Whitney Houston and foster a sense of inclusivity and diversity. However, my life's movie will include creating a united network of black professionals, all of whom are passionate about working towards the prosperity of our global community.",

      "essay": "I close my eyes and find myself within a forest of lights.\n\nThe diamond leaves of gnarled oak trees throw spectrums of color onto mounds of frosty snow that gleam melancholily under the moonlight. The leaves chime as wind violently rustles them in a haunting melody. I splinter a leaf off its branch and inspect the shard of my illusion, eyes dancing with amusement.\n\nI breathe a cloud into the nipping air and half­consciously crunch through a path of snow as it languorously carves its way through the forest. I walk to the sound of clinking, broken gems as they scratch my ankles, and wonder what circuitry must be alight in my wits to create this particular fantasy. I stumble along in hope of unravelling this enigma, my mind guiding me on its own inclination.\n\nThe path opens up at last, and I approach a cabin shrouded by thick fog. The door opens for me and I wonder at the foreboding as I sit in a cherry­wood chair and sip a sparkling chartreuse drink. My feet swing idly as I listen to the forest’s indiscernible whispers, wondering whether my mind would ever allow me to unstitch its knots.\n\nAs I dwell in my worries, a cold hand reaches from behind me and taps my shoulder.\n\nI jerk away, fear bubbling in my amygdala as I look into the nonexistent eyes of my intruding visitor.\n\nThe moon illuminates a blob of pink squish as it draws back slowly, points its spindly hands towards my drink and asks: “Could I have some of that?”\n\nI wordlessly offer the eerie thing some Mountain Dew. I watch as it eagerly chugs the drink, and think, Ah. My mind is definitely acting strangely today.\n\nThe blob wipes its invisible mouth with its nonexistent sleeve. I ask: “What are you?”\n\nIt shakes its head, invigorated with soda. “S’pose it’s natural not to recognize me.” The thing smiles ominously and declares itself as my brain.\n\nI stare mutely at the absurd being. I wonder at how I will be able to paint it in my waking state.\n\nThe blob tells me to stop looking at it so suspiciously. “I can prove it,” It says. I tell it, please, go ahead.\n\nSuddenly we are back in the glowing forest. “Diamonds? Pah!” The blob dismisses them. Instantly, the leaves turn solid gold, the snow melts, and the wintry world is thrown into a blistering summer.\n\nThe blob laughs heartlessly. “Your cortex is under my control,” it says smugly.\n\nI blink under the sudden intensity and acknowledge its greatness, humbled by its supremacy.\n\n“I heard you had a question for me?” It taps its invisible ears knowingly.\n\nThis is perfect, I think. Here I was all this time wandering through my mind, searching for the answer, when now I could ask my brain for it directly.\n\nThe blob wriggles its invisible brows as it waits.\n\nI open my mouth and ask it my most crucial question.\n\nIt smiles that wicked smile. It laughs that sinful laugh. Then that insufferable blob wakes me up.\n\nAs I sit up in the dark and rub my bleary eyes, I am vaguely aware of the deep­set unfulfillment settling itself inside me. I yawn and plop back into bed, the soft red glow of my alarm clock indicating that it is still before midnight.\n\nI cover myself with blanket, and drift back into sleep to continue my search.",

      "essay": "In the short time I've been a youth leader, I've learned that my role is to make sure that each kid feels like they have a voice and that every lesson we teach allows kids of all identities to feel more welcome in our Church community. As a leader for my youth group, I review lectures sent to us by the youth ministry organization, Life Teen, and my team makes sure that they are engaging enough for our kids to stay focused. Every so often, we'll come across a more controversial topic, so we have to be careful about how we present it to the kids. On one particular day, we planned to discuss how the Church views the exploration of gender identity. However, our adult leaders did not have enough time to consult our team of youth leaders to review it and make it more relatable to the kids. As they taught the lesson, my team and I realized that what the lesson plans were stating about the transgender community could turn some of our members away from Christianity instead of bringing them closer to God. My main issue was that the lesson plan inaccurately depicted the transgender experience by assuming that they view gender and sex as \"customizable\" without allowing a transgender person to explain the issues that they face within our society. I crafted an email expressing our concerns and sent it to the leader of the LifeTeen organization. A few weeks later, they responded with no indication of them changing the original lesson plan to more accurately depict gender identity. Because of their inability to relay information to a modern audience, we stopped using their lesson plans to discuss social issues within our youth group. At our next meeting, I suggested that we have a more in-depth discussion about gender identity so the kids could express how they felt about the topic as well. I was proud that they also recognized that all humans, including transgender people, have a place within the Church and that they realized that God cares more about the content of our character.\n",

      "essay": "In 2019, I traveled to Honduras through Frontline Missions Inc. Our primary focus was to build relationships with the Tolupan people of Flower Mountain and attempt to improve various aspects of their lives. By setting up a clinic, helping with the construction of a septic tank, and hiking up school supplies for children, we were able to show them that we care about their well-being. I decided to make my trips to Honduras a yearly affair, but the impact of COVID-19 on travel restrictions made it impossible to do so. I couldn't just sit back and wonder what was happening with the community I was dedicated to serving. Even though volunteering and service can impact our own lives, I believe that it is much more important to focus on continual support towards the communities we serve. It takes more than just one day or one week to provide effective change. While COVID-19 may have stopped me from physically going back to Honduras, I knew that I could find a way to continue supporting the Tolupan community. My next action was translating my love for art into a benefit, which eventually inspired me to create and sell a coloring book to raise money in support of that community. The devastation in Honduras in 2020 caused by flooding made it especially important to reach the goal of providing relief to the numerous families and individuals suffering from the effects of the damage. So, during the summer of 2020, 1 created a 60-page coloring book which I then sold and used the profits to create care packages full of toiletries, flood relief items, and other necessities. Since travel has slowly started to open back up, I delivered my care packages to one of the leaders at Frontline Missions and she was able to travel to Honduras to give the care packages to numerous families. It excites me to know that my efforts were able to make an impact, and I hope to travel back to Honduras again one day to continue to provide support to the Tolupan community.",

I am also interested in UPenn's Community Service Initiatives because of the way they integrate service to the local community with the application of skills learned in the classroom. My future goal is to become a psychiatrist and assist young kids and adolescents in their struggles with mental health. I feel that having the chance to serve the Philadelphia community by volunteering exposes me to an important aspect of my future career and supports UPenn's larger mission to impact the world in positive ways. To me, choosing a school to attend is not just about the quality of the education I would receive. Choosing a college is the first step to building a future. I admire that UPenn is committed to merging its students with the surrounding Philadelphia community so that after graduation, finding a place to call \"home\" isn't as difficult. The fact that the University of Pennsylvania expresses its dedication to fostering the development of problem-solving, communication, and collaboration skills allows me to know that UPenn values the success of its students. I know that the skills I gain and the support I receive from the University of Pennsylvania will enhance my transition from undergraduate studies to medical school. Additionally, I admire the unique opportunities both on-campus and near the campus that will allow me to further my studies in the Chinese language and culture. Particularly, I am eager to study abroad in China and participate in Chinese House activities to improve my conversational skills. Through UPenn, I hope to increase my proficiency in Chinese and explore a non-Western approach to discussions and concepts within the field of psychology. Most importantly, I know that at the University of Pennsylvania, I will gain the expertise needed for success in my future career and I will expand my worldview to better understand and contribute to serving the needs of our global community.

      "essay": "During the summer of 2020, I created a 60-page coloring book which I then sold and used the profits to create care packages full of toiletries, flood relief items, and other necessities to support the Tolupan community of Honduras. In the previous year, I had traveled to Honduras through Frontline Missions Inc. Our primary focus was to build relationships with the Tolupan people of Flower Mountain and attempt to improve various aspects of their lives. By setting up a clinic, helping with the construction of a septic tank, and hiking up school supplies for children, we were able to show them that we care about their well- being. I decided to make my trips to Honduras a yearly affair, but the impact of COVID-19 on travel restrictions made it impossible to do so. I couldn't just sit back and wonder what was happening with the community I was dedicated to serving. Even though volunteering and service can impact our own lives, I believe that it is much more important to focus on continual support towards the communities we serve. It takes more than just one day or one week to provide effective change. While I may have been physically hindered from going back to Honduras, I knew that I could find a way to continue supporting the Tolupan community. My next action was translating my love for art into a benefit, which eventually inspired me to create and sell my coloring book to raise money in support of that community. The devastation in Honduras in 2020 caused by flooding made it especially important to reach the goal of providing relief to the numerous families and individuals suffering from the effects of the damage. Since travel restrictions have somewhat reduced, I delivered my care packages to a leader at Frontline Missions and she traveled to Honduras to distribute the care packages to numerous families. It excites me to know that my efforts were able to make an impact, and I hope to travel back to Honduras again one day to continue to provide support to the Tolupan community. ",

      "essay": "I currently serve as a core leader for my youth group. I plan lectures and discussions, and my team makes sure that the lessons are engaging enough for our kids to stay focused. Our youth group is a part of the youth ministry organization, Life Teen, and they send us outlines that we review for our lectures. Occasionally, we'll come across a more controversial topic, so we have to be careful about how we present it to the kids. On one particular day, we planned to discuss gender identity and how the Church views the exploration of gender identity. However, because we received the outline for that lesson a bit later than usual, our adult leaders did not have enough time to consult our team of youth leaders to review it and make it more relatable to the kids. As the adults taught the lesson, my team members and I were hearing the points made by Life Teen regarding gender identity and the transgender community. We realized that what the lesson plans were stating could turn some of our members away from Christianity instead of bringing them closer to God. My main issue was that the lesson plan brought up an alternative viewpoint on gender identity and tried to debunk it without acknowledging the research scientists have done to establish that viewpoint. The only evidence the lesson provided to disprove the opposing perspective came from the Bible, a source that someone new to the faith or someone questioning their beliefs would not see as credible. It would have been better for Life Teen to enlist either an expert on gender identity or a transgender person to explain issues that many transgender people face in our society. To me, the lesson plan inaccurately depicted the transgender experience by assuming that they view gender and sex as \"customizable\" without allowing transgender people to describe their true feelings. Our entire mission as a youth group is to show that God loves and accepts all of us for who we are. We believe that He cares more about the content of our character and how we can positively affect our world. As a member of the LGBTQ+ community myself, I was uncomfortable with the lesson plan's careless depictions of transgender individuals, but I felt the need to defend what I believed. So, I crafted an email expressing our concerns, and I sent it to the leader of the Life Teen organization. A few weeks later, I got a response with no indication that they would change the original lesson plan to a more accurate depiction of gender identity. I was disappointed at first but realized I was lucky to have a team of leaders who agreed with the concerns I had presented to LifeTeen. We decided that from then on, we wouldn't use their lesson plans to discuss social issues within our youth group because of their inability to relay the information to a modern audience. At our next meeting, I suggested that we have a more in- depth discussion about gender identity so that the kids could express how they felt about the topic as well, and I was proud that they recognized that all humans have a place within the Church. I'm no longer afraid to use my voice to stand up to people in authority. As a college student, I plan to support underrepresented groups in their struggles, even if that means sacrificing my comfort. I would never speak over someone more qualified to discuss an issue within their community, but I promise to value the opinions and experiences of all students, no matter their background. ",

      "essay": "During the summer of 2020, I created a 60-page coloring book which I then sold and used the profits to create care packages full of toiletries, flood relief items, and other necessities to support the Tolupan community of Honduras. In the previous year, I had traveled to Honduras through Frontline Missions Inc. Our primary focus was to build relationships with the Tolupan people of Flower Mountain and attempt to improve various aspects of their lives. By setting up a clinic, helping with the construction of a septic tank, and hiking up school supplies for children, we were able to show them that we care about their well- being. I decided to make my trips to Honduras a yearly affair, but the impact of COVID-19 on travel restrictions made it impossible to do so. I couldn't just sit back and wonder what was happening with the community I was dedicated to serving. Even though volunteering and service can impact our own lives, I believe that it is much more important to focus on continual support towards the communities we serve. It takes more than just one day or one week to provide effective change. While I may have been physically hindered from going back to Honduras, I knew that I could find a way to continue supporting the Tolupan community. My next action was translating my love for art into a benefit, which eventually inspired me to create and sell my coloring book to raise money in support of that community. The devastation in Honduras in 2020 caused by flooding made it especially important to reach the goal of providing relief to the numerous families and individuals suffering from the effects of the damage. Since travel restrictions have somewhat reduced, I delivered my care packages to a leader at Frontline Missions and she traveled to Honduras to distribute the care packages to numerous families. It excites me to know that my efforts were able to make an impact, and I hope to travel back to Honduras again one day to continue to provide support to the Tolupan community.",

Most of you know me, but for those who don't, I'm a sophomore, and I'm here to tell you about how [redacted] is going to help you get to college.\"\n\nAt the beginning of my sophomore year, I was offered the chance to represent the student body and work along with five other students to create lesson plans and other activities to expose students to the possibilities after high school.\n\nAt the time, my school consisted only of freshmen and sophomores, and as part of the very first graduating class, there were no upperclassmen to look up to. Ninety-nine other 15-16 year-olds and I were the oldest students on campus - we were the example for the freshmen, and with that came the truly unique opportunity to be role models and to leave an impact on the future of our school.\n\nI realized this and decided I wanted to do more than just lessons and activities - they were great, but I wanted to present the same enamor that I had for the future after high school. I felt that only a current student could articulate the anxiety and anticipation surrounding the daunting years ahead, and only a current student could reassure their peers that those feelings were appropriate. I pitched my idea to my teammates, and we agreed to each focus on an aspect of pre and post-graduation experience, putting in extra hours after school to brainstorm and rehearse for our presentation at the next community meeting. Our presentation ended up a success. Both students and staff were appreciative of our efforts - a student described it as \"eye-opening\" - then I knew that we truly did benefit our community with our message, even though that impact may have been small. We were pioneers: we transformed our school's landscape, ever slowly, ever slightly, but nevertheless transforming it - for the better.",

My father discovered birding soon after COVID hit, using it as a way to get outdoors. He soon became swept up in 3 AM Sunday alarms, long-range camera lenses, and text alerts for bird sightings. Sooner than later, I became captivated as well, joining him on his quest for rare birds. Oftentimes, we were fruitless, staying hours at a single spot to no avail. However, we never came back empty-handed- always finding something worth sharing, and over time, we became better at spotting birds, our eyes tuned to sharp movement and our ears able to identify between swallows and sparrows. Birding was our way to bond - whenever I find myself gazing into trees, I think of my father, and all the moments we shared together.\n",

I'm ecstatic when I peel the plastic off a new map and delighted when I discover a novel way to view a geographical feature on one that's yellowed.\n\nMy interest in the brain shares that same rapture, as I view it in the same way. I bridge two disparate fields - geography and neuroscience - through visualization and mapping, applying the same thinking and logic from neural connections to the Atlas mountains. I clamp my fist to imagine the cerebellum, follow my print of our cerebrospinal fluid pathways with my pinkie, and remind myself \"Amygdala\" is ah- mig-dala, not ah-migd-ala.\n\nYet, one map particularly fascinates me: the connectome, a diagram of all the neurons in an organism's brain. For worms and flies, this is relatively unrevealing, but for an 86-billion neuron brain that gives rise to abstract thoughts, methodical decisions, and profound emotions, it spotlights how brain disorders develop and influences machine learning.

I found myself delving into a rabbit hole, one where I was often left with more questions than answers. Rather than feeling frustrated when met with that outcome, I feel satisfied knowing that there is so much more for me to learn.\n\nTo me, the beauty of neuroscience is that, like many subjects, so much remains to be challenged, reevaluated, and discovered. I'm especially attracted to neuroscience specifically, however, because of how it leverages biology, chemistry, and psychology, as well as less directly correlated fields like physics, computer science - even philosophy and linguistics. It's an avenue full of intersections that I'll pursue, from diving further into my initial interest in neuromodulators to exploring new ventures in connectomics.

Columbia's Core Curriculum enables my tightrope walk across both worlds of humanities and science, treating them as complementary rather than conflicting, creating a symphony of intellectual experiences. At Columbia, I imagine myself having lively debates with peers with topics ranging from our interpretations of Kafka's \"Metamorphosis\" in Literature Humanities to discussing the possible ethical concerns of CRISPR in Frontiers of Science.

The\n\nmost appealing aspect of self-studying was the freedom it granted me; one that sparked ambition and drive to\n\nmatch my curiosity and interest in the subjects.\n\nI felt that same freedom igniting my nerves in a lecture on the chemistry of coffee - specifically, how the compound\n\ncaffeine blocks adenosine, preventing us from feeling tired. I left with a curiosity to understand more, fascinated by\n\nthe subjects discussed. I found myself delving into rabbit hole after rabbit hole, from the world of neuromodulators\n\nand neurotransmitters to the storied history behind the discovery of caffeine. Soon, I became hooked to neuroscience, attracted to how it leveraged subjects like biology, chemistry, and psychology, as well as less\n\ndirectly correlated fields like physics, computer science - even philosophy and linguistics. It was an avenue full of\n\nintersections I could pursue, in both areas that I had discovered and areas I hadn't.\n\nI've found Brown's open curriculum offers that same freedom, one that energizes me and lets my interests\n\nblossom, a freedom that allows me to flush out a concentration in neuroscience as unique as the creator, as well\n\nas broach the many subjects I have yet to appreciate fully; a freedom that will take me from neuroeconomics to\n\nbehavioral philosophy to visual arts to bioethics; a freedom that lets me embrace all aspects of learning. intellectual and emotional; a freedom that I yearn for.",

      "essay": "I first learned about CRISPR in a Radiolab podcast, captivated by its advanced acronym name and its unique abilities. I was excited by its science fiction-esque potential to change our world, believing that the technology could transform our medical landscape for the better. I thought it could lead to the eradication of cancer, HIV, and other previously untreatable diseases. Through Radiolab, I was introduced to the many positive prospects that CRISPR could bring. It wasn't until a discussion on the ethics of CRISPR in my biology class that I discovered many, many viewpoints and positions that had never even come to mind. Peers brought up how a human gene-editing tool would further the inequities in society, how it could lead to divisions within classes, and how it could be abused in a similar way to insulin: completely regulated by third-party corporations who care more about their profit than the wellbeing of who it's for. That discussion left me stunned, my science fiction dream more dystopian than I imagined as I began to understand a fully comprehensive idea. From that discussion, I shaped my opinion on CRISPR to one that acknowledges both the potential benefits and the potential injustices; one that considers both the ideals behind its creation and an unjustifiable future it may face. At Brown, I know the countless conversations and debates I'll have will lead to a deeper understanding of the nuances in our world, the optics of our ideas molded by our diverse perspectives and experiences.",

How can we make the huge technological advances of the 21st century accessible to everyone rather than a select few?\n\nI am thrilled to answer this question through a mechanical engineering major at Columbia. In conjunction with the communal learning and critical dialogue that the Core Curriculum fosters, I am eager to engage with the interdisciplinary program in rehabilitation robotics with Professor Agrawal and biomedical research projects with Professor Ateshian. This combination of structure and freedom is well-suited for my product design and entrepreneurial interests and also satisfies my intellectual curiosity. \n\nFurthermore, since I started fencing in 2013, I’ve dreamed of being on a Division 1 team. The individualized training that Columbia’s fencing program offers along with the opportunity to practice at New York Athletic Club with some of the world’s best fencers will help me achieve my athletic goals. After speaking with Coach Aufrichtig and watching the Columbia Lions compete at NCAA championships, I know that no other team in the country would make me more proud to be a student athlete. \n\nMy curiosity extends far beyond athletics and academics. From baking my favorite bread for social justice with Challah for Hunger to fighting for diversity in STEM with the Society of Women Engineers, I can’t wait to contribute to Columbia’s vibrant community. I am excited to be immersed in the heartland of all of my interests and plan on making frequent trips to the Frick and local Russian banyas. \n\nNo other university offers the perfect balance of academics, athletics, and culture.

      "essay": "“Who are you?”\n\nMy answer to this question used to change more frequently than undergraduates switching their majors. After years of searching, however, I have finally settled on a consistent response: I am a peacock.\n\nI was introduced to this peculiar idea during the first group activity at the National Student Leadership and Engineering Conference, a two-week program that hosts career-focused courses for high schoolers. I sat alongside 49 other confused students when the “Animal Personality Matrix” was introduced. I met this activity with opposition, afraid we would not retain our true selves after being separated into groups based on our fur-to-feather ratio. Nonetheless, I completed the personality quiz and found that I have qualities associated with lions, owls, and koalas, but I am predominantly a pheasant with extravagant plumage: the peacock (interactive, playful, expressive).\n\nI put my personality to the test during the first competition, which asked my teammates and I to construct an economically efficient mini-wind-turbine with limited resources. The judges explained that to get money for these resources, each team must showcase their talents. The owl in me (conscientious, detailed, prepared) quickly surveyed the situation, developing a master plan which included at least one person in line to showcase talents while the rest of the group built the turbine. For a few rounds, the plan ran smoothly. Then everything came to a halt when Carl, a self-proclaimed engineering nerd, professed himself talentless.\n\nWorried that our group dynamic might be compromised, I put down the handheld generator I was wiring, mustered up some lion courage (direct, confident, results-oriented), and gave Carl a pep talk. Instead of pressuring him, I did everything I could to make him feel comfortable, cracking jokes and sharing my go-to icebreaker: a childhood anecdote in which I embarrassed myself by colliding with onlookers while attempting to showcase my cartwheel. Carl paused, deliberating, and finally agreed that he had nothing to lose.\n\nFive minutes later, our group roared encouragement as he showed off his double-jointed shoulders and break-dancing skills at the talent table. While Carl embraced his inner peacock, I connected with the koala in me (supportive, patient, sensitive) and felt proud to have gently urged the most reticent of birds to spread his wings.\n\nThe zenith of the conference came in the final activity: the product pitch. As the rest of the students filed into the auditorium, I guided my group to the stage where a zoo of eyes viewed us expectantly. We quivered with anticipation, collectively reflecting on the week of preparation that would become synonymous with this moment. I remembered how my internal peacock rumbled during our prototyping sessions, my expressive nature manifesting with each fresh idea I contributed to our carbon emission-fighting machine’s construction. My inner bird’s chirps had grown louder as I facilitated intricate connections between my peers, weaving everyone’s research into a cohesive product pitch. \n\nAs I stepped up to the microphone, my feathers finally unfurled. “Why does the climate want privacy?” I asked. A beat, then: “Because it’s changing.”\n\nAfter a moment of silence, the audience howled like a pack of rhesus monkeys stumbling on a Kit-Kat. They were hooked. Over the next fifteen minutes, I playfully relayed climate change jokes to supplement our clean-energy product presentation. Not only had I fanned out my kaleidoscopic sheath of feathers to the public for the first time, but I was chosen as my group’s MVP after we won the overall competition.\n\nIn our moment of victory, I understood that the alleged confinement of personality typecasting can serve as a foundation for growth and exploration in every imaginable direction. The conference helped me discover the joy in leading my classmates and friends to uncover and exercise new talents. Now I eagerly scan the open waters for new possibilities with a peacock figurehead perched at my bow.",

      "essay": "Traveling back from a last-minute audition, I rested my head against the train’s frosted window as my exuberance dissipated into the old industrial buildings and barren trees. The stained, stiff seats of the Boston commuter rail became increasingly uncomfortable as I realized my acceptance to the Houston Ballet Academy on full scholarship launched me down a path of uncertainty and unfamiliarity.\n\nTwo years earlier, when I moved to Providence, Rhode Island from New York City, I was a staunch proponent of New York’s superiority and the balletic style of the School of American Ballet (SAB). My head inflated with the knowledge and perspectives I cherished from New York; I was often too critical of my new home state and peers.\n\nTightening my blinders, I trained at a studio where I could dance without fear of any paradigm-shattering intervention from teachers. I resisted many corrections and even refused to wear the uniform; I thought a return to the comforts of New York was imminent.\n\nHowever, my closed-minded plans were shattered when SAB rejected me from their summer program and I was forced to consider schools of different styles. Soon thereafter, Houston Ballet Academy offered me a spot in their summer intensive program. I was relieved, grateful, and apprehensive about changing my balletic approach.\n\nMy first day at the academy, my self-image was immediately challenged. I stood at my barre spot before class and observed the year-round students execute masterful pirouettes, tours en l’air, and révoltades. As I watched my new peers, I caught my first glimpse of how little I actually knew.\n\nMy limits were revealed further when I sprained my right ankle four times in a year-long period. As I sat in the treatment room again with my ankle wrapped in ice, I realized my understanding of dance technique was as underdeveloped as my musculature – it was time to shed my former preconceptions.\n\nI began striving to understand kinesthetic work in dance. I learned to observe other dancers to improve my own work. I consulted physical trainers to address my muscular imbalances, mitigating my perspective imbalances in the process. More generally, I consulted older students about the nuances of Houston Ballet’s professional environment and clarified my artistic intentions through movement: to explore and share. \n\nLiving in the dorms, I found myself surrounded with people of drastically varying perspectives. I debated gender with a conservative from Oklahoma, discussed ethical constructs with a dancer-turned-rock-climber from Oregon, and delved into the philosophy of ballet with a bilingual Japanese-American friend. Being surrounded by talented, driven students from all over the world opened my mind to alternate viewpoints while honing my critical thinking skills. I ventured into new realms of intellectual and kinesthetic thought, seeking to broaden my understanding of dance, athleticism, and art.\n\nI had thought my four hours of dancing per day after school in Rhode Island was rigorous. Now in Houston and enrolled in online high school, the average dance day was nine to ten hours; some days exceeded twelve during busy rehearsal periods or show runs. Dealing with the physical stress of my new schedule further encouraged my holistic development: I adopted healthier sleeping, eating, and stretching habits to prioritize my body’s well-being.\n\nI have discovered that training to be a dancer is more than just physical work in the studio – it entails development as an athlete, artist, and thinker. As with innovative academic research, the artistic and intellectual synergy of dance at a professional-level academy warrants deep thought, humility, and exploration. My daily practice has required me to become comfortable with the uncertain, the unfamiliar, and the uncomfortable to gain the openness necessary to learn and grow. Now, I am eager to be challenged in the studio, the classroom, and throughout life.",

      "essay": "During the Spring of 2019, I spent countless hours alone in the dance studio striving to find my artistic voice after full days of training. Inspired by renowned Canandian dancer and choreographer Crystal Pite, I explored the language of dance through improvisation, seeking to  express myself as she could through her deeply emotional, intellectual work.\n\nAfter zealously watching Pite’s pieces online, learning her movement phrases in contemporary class, and building off her style in improvisation, I was ready to make something of my own. So, when the opportunity arose to choreograph at Houston Ballet Academy’s summer intensive, I seized it.\n\nI had a large cast of dancers, an original score, a Dalí painting my composer used as inspiration, and very few rehearsals to make an artistic statement. Consequently, I spent hours upon hours wrestling uninspired movement out of my body, desperately trying to force creativity. After a week of unproductive, embittering work, I thought I would never be able to create powerful art like Pite’s The Seasons’ Canon or The Tempest Replica.\n\nFrustrated, I sat in my room reflecting on my process. I wanted to craft fiercely physical movement loaded with emotional meaning – as Pite did so compellingly – but had no idea how to reify that desire. I thought about her treatment of dance as a universal language that can speak to people viscerally. Then it hit me: I had no clear message. Pite used the language of dance to express something specific, whereas I had been treating movement as a vapid series of physical gestures. The image of the Dalí painting arose in my mind – it conveyed loneliness, pain, and melancholy. I would do the same with my piece.\n\nI jumped on my computer and consulted one of my favorite clips of Pite’s work: the dancers of the Royal Ballet rehearsing Flight Pattern, which examined the refugee crisis to Górecki’s Symphony of Sorrowful Songs. In the piece, she used claw-like hands to emphasize the body’s ability to fill and carve out space, which seemed oddly evocative of the pain in the painting.\n\nThe next day, I took the movement and played with it. I improvised with my hands tense and claw-like and soon felt like they were wielding power. I thought of Pite’s tool of using opposing forces in the body to incite dynamic movement and runimated on power’s corrupting nature. As I felt the rest of my body resist and react to the motions of my hands, the theme became clear: my piece was about the volatile, exploitative relationship between humans and power.\n\nI stopped moving and started to write. I wrote about my impressions of power, how different people deal with its burden, and its manifestation in one person versus in a group. I crafted formations and envisioned lighting and costume schemes, deciding that a green, dark background and contrasting black-and-white costumes would underscore my theme effectively. Every night, I researched contemporary pieces by various choreographers, always including a clip of Pite’s work.\n\nBy the time I started rehearsing with my cast, I had spacing and counts for the entire piece, detailed notes on each section, and a finished opening. I strove to be decisive yet adaptable, entering the rehearsals with solidified ideas but incorporating my dancers’ input and feedback. The sections that best expressed the theme were the most collaborative in creation, where I used my prepared ideas only as starting points. When I saw my cast execute it masterfully on stage, I silently thanked Pite for unknowingly guiding my creative growth.\n\nCrystal Pite taught me that artistic creation is an achievable, rewarding process if armed with the proper tools and perspectives. Taking from her paradigm, I had developed my own creation that communicated a visceral, challenging, and disconcerting take on power. Because of her, I look forward to creating new work that inspires others and enriches my corner of the world.",

We relished our time twirling with hula hoops, leaping across the studio, and sharing hugs and laughter.\n\nLater, we choreographed a piece to Taylor Swift’s “Bad Blood” and brought our enthusiasm to my high school’s outdoor Fall Festival, nailing every step to a roar of applause.

      "essay": "This morning, I read from right to left in an ancient script devoid of vowels and punctuation. The Talmud is an Aramaic collection of arguments concerning Jewish law, which I’ve studied in school since seventh grade. Rather than dogmatically memorize the laws of Judaism, my class parses through the Talmud’s challenging text to strengthen our reasoning skills. I’ve always been fascinated by the methods of the Talmud’s sages. It spoke directly to my innate passion for logical reasoning and philosophical inquiry.\n\nTo nurture my blossoming interest, I took a philosophy elective as a junior. We spent much of the year dwelling on the enigma of consciousness, pondering fascinating thought experiments, and considering viewpoints from Kant to Descartes. I often left class feeling less sure of the truth than when I entered, though my teacher assured me that Plato would be proud.\n\nAs much as I loved probing the depths of reason, I came to realize that thoughts, however profound, are merely thoughts. Whether through court verdicts or government legislation, philosophy needs real-world application to impact meaningful change. With this in mind, I joined my school’s Model United Nations team. My experience negotiating, drafting, and passing resolutions, in conjunction with my philosophical foundation, helped me engage in effective discourse.\n\nSuch discourse is disappearing at an alarming rate. In today’s political climate, I look around and notice significant polarization. Our inability to compromise is threatening our nation’s democracy. When we can’t pass new legislation, we lose the ability to bring ideas into the real world. This past summer, I spoke with Penn Professor Sophia Rosenfeld about her book Democracy and Truth. As we discussed approaches to minimize polarization, she emphasized that the responsibility falls on my generation to take part in an open dialogue. Our democracy depends on it.\n\nTaking her advice to heart, I’m eager to work toward my goal of depolarization at Penn with philosophy as my engine. I plan to take courses like Public Philosophy, where I’ll learn to discern philosophy’s role in civic life and democratic society. I will join clubs like the Penn Political Coalition, which promotes civil discourse across the political spectrum. I also hope to conduct research under Professor Matthew Levendusky, who studies partisan media influence on mass polarization.\n\nPenn is the ideal environment to pursue my interests in philosophy and politics. Rather than confine me to my major, the College of Arts and Sciences offers a unique interdisciplinary education. As such, I will be able to explore my interests across far-ranging and seemingly unrelated fields, from moral philosophy to astrophysics. I take comfort in knowing that my future career could lay in any building along Locust Walk, just waiting for me to find it.",

Although I eventually gained English fluency, my perceptual skills have followed me throughout the course of my life. Today, reading people is a not-so-hidden talent that inspires me to tailor every interaction to my audience.\n\nThe worst advice I have ever received as a public speaker is to just “forget the audience is there.” For me, intellectual excitement lies in discovering the human element hiding in the depths of the abstract.

As a friend, I provide nudges, laughs, and tear-welcoming shoulders based upon perceived needs.\n\nI am excited to continue honing my perceptual skills as a member of Stanford’s diverse community. There is nothing more intellectually invigorating than gathering perspectives and predicting how those perspectives will play out in a variety of contexts.

      "essay": "Fueled by our disappointment in the lack of unity both within our high school and the greater Houston community, my friends and I started BackPAC, a non-partisan political action committee with the mission of raising political awareness and facilitating discourse among the youth demographic. In classroom #1588, we’ve hosted weekly discussions that bridge polar opposite viewpoints by fostering genuine listening and ensuring that everyone is given a voice.\n\nAs a club, we have managed to forge a fundamental agreement about the contentious issue of gun control: school safety should be the ultimate priority regardless of political stance. We’ve contacted state congressmen and legislators, pushing for school safety reform laws. After a year of countless calls and emails, students are now mandated to wear their IDs to school. Though progress has taken significant time and effort, this rule is a tangible step toward true reform and proof of the power working collectively to bring about impactful change.\n\nAfter two years, BackPAC is the largest student-run political action committee in the country, spread across 25 states with over 100 chapters. By registering each of these chapters as official voter booths, we’ve increased voter registration among eligible high-schoolers by almost 400%. No matter how much we grow, however, the smallest interactions are still the most inspiring. A turban-wearing student shaking hands with a football player is enough to have made all of our efforts well worth it. After all, it’s more than just a handshake. It’s progress.",

      "essay": "A single, dim light bulb hung from the dingy ceiling. Its flicker momentarily illuminated Eram’s face, revealing the powerful amber in her eyes. We sat at a stained folding table, discussing her life as a Rohingya refugee. She was sixteen, just like me, and had fled to Bangladesh after participating in a Muslim Women’s March against the Burmese government. Her parents were killed before her eyes, and her younger sister was missing.\n\nSeven months earlier and 8,719 miles away, I peered over my father’s shoulder at his Bangladeshi newspaper on the kitchen table: “800,000 Rohingya Displaced, Millions More Dead.” I was astounded by this headline, but even more baffled by the fact that I hadn’t seen reports of this mass exodus to Bangladesh on any American news source. Every report that I could find on the Internet treated refugees as pieces of a larger political game.\n\nI yearned for something beyond cold, hard statistics, and knew that in order to gain the human-level understanding of the issue I craved, I had to visit the refugee camps myself. I contacted the principal of Dhaka Medical College in Bangladesh, proposing a research project and promising to raise awareness of the refugee crisis in America. Two months later, I was on a plane to Kutupalong, a UNHCR camp.\n\nWhen I first arrived, I exited a chipped, sky-blue rickshaw, and found myself standing at the top of a hill at the center of Kutupalong refugee camp. People were strewn across the muddy ground and their “homes” were nothing but pieces of rusty metal, splintered wood, and torn fabric stapled together. They drifted about with eyes fixed on the ground and shoulders drooping. \n\nIt looked like the warzone the refugees had fled from had followed them to the camp. Anger kindled inside me at the sight of the deplorable conditions. Although I had always felt proud of my home country’s hospitality – the very hospitality that provided refuge for my grandfather in the 1950s – within seconds of arrival, that pride was extinguished by overwhelming guilt.\n\nThe first person I interacted with was a frail child of about seven years. His ribs poked out from beneath his skin, his clothes were shredded, and his eyes were lifeless. When I reached out to shake his hand, he held out both palms, thinking I was offering him food. I knew right away that he needed more than my privileged pity.\n\nHad my parents not immigrated to America to escape growing tensions in Eastern Bangladesh, this could’ve been my life. Motivated by this realization, I embarked upon my proposed research question with vehemence: how do camp conditions affect the psychological development of Rohingya children?\n\nIn Dr. Masuma’s cramped wooden cottage, I set out to analyze the refugee children’s 82% mental health disorder rate through the lens of Maslow’s Hierarchy of Needs, whilst grappling with the fact that the United Nations Higher Commission for Refugees could barely fulfill the baseline physiological tier. I learned that Dr. Masuma was one of only eight therapists on the entire site. With a total population of 120,000, there was one therapist for every 16,000 refugees. Moreover, most refugee children were unable to articulate their thoughts and emotions to the already scarce English-speaking therapists. My fluency in Bangla allowed me to conduct 6-10 informal interviews every day. The children told me about their missing family members, their inability to read or write, and their struggles with interacting with others in the camp. During these talks, I discovered the primary reason for the wide-spread depression was a lack of purpose and belonging, which was evident in the way the children aimlessly ambled around.\n\nMy interview with Eram was a pivotal moment for both my research and my own perspective. She was a painter. Her latest piece was a rally sign depicting a hijab, alongside the text “If you don’t fight for human rights, you don’t have the right to call yourself human.” She was recuperating from her exile from Myanmar, preparing to rejoin the fight for justice. Her glowing amber eyes exuded a hope that was hard to come by in the camp. I knew I had to find a way to spark the same resilient spirit in the other children.\n\nThe camp offered no intellectual opportunities or place of assembly, so I set out to transform Dr. Masuma’s cottage into a school. I designed an English as a Second Language (ESL) curriculum to foster communication between Bangla-speaking refugees and English-speaking UN agents. With the help of donated art supplies, I encouraged kids to exercise their imaginations. We watched classic Disney movies, learned how to throw frisbees, and danced to world music. Within a few weeks, the school found traction, creating a newfound sense of camaraderie.\n\nI’ve kept up with the children ever since. A little over a year later, forty-five students have passed their first English diagnostic test and the walls of the school are now covered with colorful paintings and expressive poetry. Every other week I receive a photograph of the class — each new picture twinkles with bigger and brighter smiles as their eyes shine with hope.\n\nMy experience at the camp was far more than just a research project or an informative trip. Not only did it implant my interests in international affairs and psychology, but it also showed me the humans behind the cold statistics I’m used to encountering on the news. In my ambitions to fight for peace across the world, I now know who I’m fighting for instead of just what I’m fighting against. Whether I’m crafting a debate speech or joining a political rally, I’ll remember my conviction of fighting for human rights; Eram was right — it’s what makes me human.\n\n",

      "essay": "From Mosaic Club to Model UN, I’ve participated in every activity under the sun, but I’ve learned the most from the one that literally happens under the sun: rowing. I have been rowing since I had my braces on, then off, then on again, and this sport is the bedrock of the person I am. \n\nStanding at 5” 1’ at best, I am a coxswain, also known as the small person who yells at the rowers. Being a cox requires me to take in a torrent of information and create a game plan that is continuously updated. Whether it be counting strokes, keeping the boat aligned, or deducing who is rowing out of sync and how to correct them, I am responsible for providing instantaneous feedback to my team. During regattas, along with staying focused and mentally agile, I must make sure my rowers are concentrated and motivated until the last stroke.\n\nAs agonizing as being scrunched in a small box for two hours may be, the physical discomforts of coxing are nothing compared to those of rowing. When my 8th grade crew was too small to even warrant a cox, I had to pick up the oars myself and strap into a future of callused hands and perpetual exhaustion; every time I sneezed or laughed, I was acutely aware of my abs, or lack thereof.\n\nFrom quick thoughts to quick taps, rowing splashes me awake at the crack of dawn and rocks me to sleep every night. The mental fortitude I have gained from my time on the water has prepared me for any crab my oar catches; even if I flip over, I’m back on the boat without missing a stroke.\n\nTell us about a place or community you call home. How has it shaped your perspective? (250 words)\n\nThroughout my life, I’ve been on the move. New Jersey, Australia, and Houston have all contributed to my character, but I wouldn’t say that any of those places are home. In 2014, I found my home at Canberra Girls Grammar School (CGGS) in Australia. Although I only attended this school for one year, that feeling of home is etched in my memory forever.\n\nCGGS was different from the very first day. Instead of feeling excluded, as I had in my previous school, I was welcomed. My classmates wanted me to sit with them on the bus, eager to get to know me and stay friends with me. When I wasn’t allowed to go to the school dance, my friends signed a petition to convince my parents to let me go.This place taught me what a good friend is–someone supportive and who goes the extra mile without blinking. I strive to be that same kind of friend to others.\n\nEven though I left the school five years ago, that community has shaped me into the person I am today. In addition to the close friendships I still maintain, this school introduced me to many of the passions and interests that I still have today.  My love for rowing and public speaking began at CGGS and continue to grow as I participate in Model UN and my local rowing club. Yes, I no longer attend the school, but I will always consider myself a Canberra Grammar Girl.",

While I knew that medications like Tylenol might make the pain more bearable, I was worried about exacerbating his condition.\n\nThankfully, after a week of putting 40 drops of nettle juice into warm water three times a day, my dad’s illness subsided.

I got a taste of what it takes to be a “Doctor With a Degree” during the summer of 2019, when I interned at MD Anderson. From punching in early Saturday morning to late nights scrolling through NCBI, the researchers’ diligence was omnipresent and gave me insight into the rigor of the medical profession.\n\nI decided to commit myself to that same level of professionalism. Between 11-hour shifts, cutting countless tissue cross-sections to be exactly 10 micrometers, and dissecting mice to extract their lymph nodes, I upheld the standards that had been set by my mentors. I learned that the core of professionalism is something beyond neat hair and shined shoes; it is the willingness to go the extra mile.\n\nIn addition, professionalism in the medical field means providing care for the patient, rather than just treatment. It’s explaining why the patient needs to pump their ankles, not just telling them to do it. It’s spending however long it takes to understand the patient’s issues and using that information to formulate the best treatment plan. It’s treating all patients like they’re your mother or father because they often are someone else’s. Professionalism in the medical field stems from the harmony of compassion and logic, a delicate balance that I will strive to cultivate, even after I become a Doctor with a Degree. ",

      "essay": "It was two days before the Model UN conference. As I – well, “Venustiano Carranza” – dug into Mexico’s preventative measures against the Spanish Flu, I realized that politics and the private sector held almost as much power as scientific findings when it came to controlling infection. While a pandemic simulated by high school students might not be perfectly indicative of the real world, medicine and politics go hand in hand on the subject of healthcare.\n\nAs a second grader, I learned that we have a right to “life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness.” Healthcare is the foundation upon which those human rights stand. Without access to life-sustaining resources, we lack the freedom to think beyond the bare necessities, let alone explore our dreams and passions. Healthcare facilitates the distribution of such resources and enables the realization of the core values that America was built on, yet it is not accessible to all Americans.\n\nMy main concern is the efficiency of the healthcare system. The US spends around $3.5 trillion per year on healthcare, money that could be better allocated if issues like misdiagnoses and the health insurance oligarchy were resolved through better training for doctors and price ceilings for insurance companies. The industry is a vast yet intricate part of our society that encompasses multiple disciplines. From overpriced, highly addictive narcotics to financially-crippling medical bills, every scenario involves both politics and economics. For this reason, I plan to major in economics and take political science courses before pursuing a medical degree. By following this course of study, I will obtain the perspectives of the government, private sector, healthcare provider, and most importantly, the consumer.\n\nThe unorthodox path I plan to take can only be met by Brown’s unconventional approach to education. As part of the PLME program at Brown, I will be given the freedom to develop wide-ranging perspectives on healthcare, delving into the rigors of medicine while receiving a top-tier liberal arts education. I am eager to take courses like Health Economics with Professor Lancaster and Ethics and Public Policy with Professor Cheit and to attend seminars like Health, Hunger, and Household throughout my undergraduate career. While learning how to handle a scalpel and perform a running stitch, I will also understand the weight of the caduceus emblazoned on my lab coat. Furthermore, the PLME program takes away the added pressures of the MCAT, which will allow me to focus on learning as opposed to studying. This will allow me to dedicate myself to experiential learning opportunities like lab work and volunteering in a health clinic. \n\nWhile Venustiano Carranza may not have had the resources to effectively manage the infrastructure of the healthcare system, armed with a Liberal Medical Education, I certainly will.",

But as I watched bees drone through the (admittedly, pretty) clover blossoms, I wondered if they were really so bad. The clover inevitably faded by summer, and letting nature run its course would attract pollinators and save me lots of weeding.

I felt helpless watching my extended family struggle in India, separated by half a world and a travel ban.\n\nTo combat this purposelessness, I took up tutoring, Zooming in with children of healthcare workers who were too busy to read to them. But as unfortunate as this situation was, I couldn’t help but think of a worse one: the children missing meals because they couldn’t get their free school lunch, or who didn’t own books with which to continue learning from home.\n\nThe bookshelves in my own home, piled with workbooks and fairy tales I hadn’t touched in ages, became a call to action. While difficult in a world of “six feet apart!” and widespread fear, I collected over 600 children’s books for underserved kids, and hundreds of dollars in donations for a local summer school program. Driving around with my newly-acquired license, I collected box after box of books from neighbors and friends, destined for children in need. Now, when I look at the slightly emptier bookshelf in my room, I see a reminder that somewhere, a child is reading my favorite copy of Frog & Toad, laughing and learning.\n\n",

      "essay": "Growing up in Houston, I loved spending my days exploring museums, theaters, or the Marshall Space Center learning about van Gogh and Moon missions, and this curiosity found a perfect outlet in the Montessori schools I attended for ten years. Excursions to courtrooms and marine science institutes fostered my love of adventure, and in the classroom I learned long division from materials like the “racks and tubes”. The emphasis on unstructured work meant I was rarely given detailed directives, so I quickly became a self-guided learner, taking initiative and setting goals independently. I applied these principles outside the classroom, too, beginning my service journey by volunteering at local preschools.\n\nAs my love of science and math grew, I became aware of another Houston landmark: the Texas Medical Center. The largest medical complex in the world, it’s a symbol of Houston’s spirit of discovery and collaboration. In 2018, TMC scientist James Allison won the Nobel in medicine just as I was exploring biology as a freshman, and it drove me to immerse myself in the sciences, something I achieved by interning at TMC.\n\nThere, I saw posters for medical conferences alongside flyers advertising makeup classes for cancer survivors and meditation coaches for patients. I learned that good hospitals exceed science, standing at the intersection of social work and medical innovation. I hope to apply such an approach to combat intellectual disabilities, a journey I can begin at MIT learning from great minds like those behind the Genetic Neuroengineering Group at McGovern.",

      "essay": "The Penn Computer Science curriculum provides students with an in-depth theoretical foundation and critical thinking skills. As someone who’s passionate about solving problems regarding mental health, law enforcement, and biases in technology, I can clearly envision leveraging Penn’s resources to combat these issues.\n\nI have found that the quickest way to accelerate my critical thinking skills is to directly dive into a hands-on project. My experience at an AI4ALL summer camp was a perfect example of this. We worked on a disaster relief project using NLP to analyze geotagged tweets in the aftermath of natural disasters and flag those which called for urgent help. Rather than being daunted by the enormity of the intellectual and technical challenges inherent to such projects, I came to class every day practically giddy at the prospect of tackling problem after problem. Do we use a supervised or unsupervised ML algorithm? How do we input the tweets? Which data structure would be best to store them?\n\nThere is no better way to get involved with a meaningful project in a hands-on setting than during a hackathon. Pennapps is one of the world’s premier platforms to rapidly ideate, collaborate, and implement solutions. I’d like to be both a participant and leader at Pennapps to inspire others to innovate in the same way that AI4ALL inspired me to use computer science to create change.\n\nAI4ALL also kickstarted my interest in data ethics, privacy, and fairness in algorithms. One issue that stood out to me was the lack of data regulation, which led to wrongful arrests of marginalized groups through facial recognition software. To combat this, I worked with a data privacy and ethics group to research facial recognition legislation, worked with expert lawmakers to advocate regulating/banning this technology, and filed FOIA requests at various police departments to gain insight into exactly how this technology was being used. With our comprehensive research, we wrote a paper outlining the issues we discovered and their possible solutions, and also hosted a nationwide webinar to educate others.\n\nAt Penn, I want to explore research opportunities in the Algorithmic Fairness and Data Privacy sector at the Warren Center for Network and Data Science to develop technology that reflects the morals and values of society. Sebastian Angel is one of the professors leading this charge with his work at the Security Research Laboratory. I’d love to work with him to understand the ways that biases permeate algorithms and potential solutions.\n\nWith a CSCI degree and a concentration in AI, I hope to be a driver for the future of ethical AI, contribute to impactful technological advancements, and ensure the creation of equitable and fair solutions for all.",

One day, as we stood near the woods playing catch, the ball bounced off course and Dan bolted after it into the trees.\n\nI followed, calling for him to stop. We’d soon gone so far into the forest that the path was beginning to fade. Dan finally slowed, plopped down in the dirt, and refused to move. I had no idea what to do. Why didn’t they cover this in the training sessions???\n\nMind racing, I found myself with nothing left to do but sit quietly with Dan until he felt so inclined to get up. Suddenly, a particular flower caught his eye, and as he ambled over to investigate, I saw my chance. I gestured towards a colorful bird, smooth stones, a perfectly climbable rock, and as he explored each one, we began inching towards camp.\n\nWe trudged into the cafeteria just in time for dinner, and as I helped him load his plate, a sense of accomplishment drowned out my exhaustion. I was proud of Dan for working with me, and proud of myself for keeping calm. I often can’t control my situation or people around me, but I can control myself. I can choose to trust in myself, think creatively to get out of any forest, and this self-confidence is essential for leaders in any situation.\n\n",

      "essay": "It was late at night, and I had already powered off my laptop when my phone buzzed:\n\n“I think we’ve made a big mistake. We have to restart the project.”\n\nStaring at the message, I was in disbelief. After working for weeks, how could he expect us to scrap everything, and still meet the fast-approaching deadline? I immediately dismissed his absurd suggestion, and my patience wore thin as he pushed back with frustratingly convincing arguments. Ultimately perceiving his suggestion as an attempt to usurp my authority, I declared that the leader decides for the team, I was the leader, and my answer was a definitive no.\n\nI have always been comfortable in leadership roles, so when my fellow students and I were divided into project teams at Cornell Summer College this year, I immediately volunteered to be our group leader. Tasked with comparing the stocks of two direct competitors and selecting the more favorable option, I decided to choose Dunkin’ Donuts over Starbucks, delegated the workload, and scheduled our research in advance. Our report was well-written, supported by sound analysis, and completed well before the deadline. Then, two days before our presentation, Thor, one of my teammates, dropped his bombshell proposal: to start the project over from scratch and pick Starbucks stock instead.\n\nUnable to sleep that night, I questioned why my leadership suddenly felt so shaky. I reassured myself that my decision to reject Thor’s motion was in the team’s best interest. Yet, I had doubts. Replaying our exchange in my mind, I began to wonder why I had been so quick to veto his suggestion. It was raised with good intentions and, despite the infeasibility of completely restarting our research last minute, could be considered in perhaps reforming aspects of our current research.\n\nHaving always thought of a leader as the gatekeeper of ideas, judging their merit and making the final call, I had for weeks treated my teammates as second fiddles. By allowing them only enough freedom to complete delegated tasks but never to influence the overall direction of the project, the work we produced “as a team” consequently reflected what I would have produced on my own. It occurred to me that my previous understanding of leadership was missing a dimension. Instead of controlling the flow of ideas with an iron grip, it dawned on me that real leaders should consider each unique perspective with an open mind so that the best insights can be capitalized upon. I realized that my teammates likely had many more valid ideas than I gave them credit for, and I became determined to change my approach.\n\nLoosening my control, I called a team meeting to broach an open-ended conversation about the direction of our project. Pleasantly surprised to be included in this way, my two other teammates expressed desires to keep our presentation as it was. To their dismay, though, Thor remained adamant about the relative strength of Starbucks stock. I encouraged my other teammates to consider his arguments with an open mind. Together, we arrived at a compromise: to short our original Dunkin’ Donuts stock and invest long-term in Starbucks, so that we could use our previous analysis while also incorporating Thor’s ideas. This time, I watched my teammates excitedly reformulate the analysis, providing feedback when requested but no longer attempting to control the process.\n\nBy empowering my teammates to bring their best ideas forward and directly influence the direction of our project, I led them to produce a presentation that exceeded the project requirements by exploring short-sell strategies. We received a 98% score for the overall project, which, although satisfying, was far overshadowed by my new, nuanced understanding of leadership. Although leaders must take charge, they must also know when to step back to allow the emergence of fresh insights from their team.\n\nNothing like a project on coffee to give me that kind of wakeup call.",

      "essay": "When I was seven, I thought garbage trucks were a conspiracy–a ploy by no-good evildoers to convince people to pay them to take their possessions. Nobody believed me, but what did they know? Despite my parents’ warnings, I biked after a Waste Management vehicle up and down a steep hill to find out what it was really up to. I fell off and returned with a shattered jaw–and shattered hopes about my theory.  \n\nI love to argue. I always have, as my parents discovered rather quickly with my childish inquiries about trash trucks and other mysteries. Asking why, why, why without surrender, I was the mastermind of what my parents dubbed “The Inquisition.”\n\nIn middle school, my innocent persistencebecame unyielding stubbornness. I thought that if other people had lousy ideas, I didn’t need to hear them, and that if their ideas were worthwhile, I had considered them already.\n\nWhen I joined the Ridgecrest Debate Team in eighth grade, I never expected debate to make me less contrarian, quite the opposite. But seizing the opportunity to learn how to argue well has paradoxically made me much more open-minded.\n\nDebate has caused me to reconsider my consistent overconfidence. At the Eurasian Debates in Istanbul last summer, for example, I advocated a ban on the hijab. Reciting the standard arguments about the dangers of Islamic fundamentalism and the hijab’s oppression of women, I was convinced that I was biking towards the truth. But my opponent, a friendly Turkish girl named Ceren who wore the veil, surprised me with her passionate defense of freedom of conscience. Her arguments forced me to weigh free speech against cultural considerations, to question what I thought to be a self-evident proposal. With my parents, I could be stubborn, but Ceren made me listen. I felt as if I was again naïve enough to go chasing garbage trucks. As she stood before me, I knew I had the chance to learn. Surprisingly, I embraced it.\n\nDebate has humbled me. Because of a girl I will probably never see again, I’ve realized that I learn most about myself when I am in unfamiliar territory and can admit defeat. At tournaments, I gaze at the world through the eyes of a Pole, a Swede, a Turk, or an Israeli. Debate denies me the dreadful peace of mind that comes with facile certainty, filling me instead with the blissful discomfort of opposing worldviews.\n\nI still devour knowledge as I did when I was seven. But in my search for certainty, I question my views as well as espouse them. Through hundreds of debates, I see my world expand and my stubbornness subside. Unlike before, when I would frustrate my parents and friends with constant interjections or righteous claims, I now am unperturbed when I do not have the answer. I realize that there is only shame in being wrong if I presume I’m right.\n\nAs a kid, I was foolish to think garbage trucks were a conspiracy, but I was right to be inquisitive. Even though my jaw has healed, the scar reminds me of my former overconfidence. I have yet to bike up many hills, but this time I will seize the lessons I have learned–to value others’ views and to be less stubborn in my own–and ride farther up than I could ever go alone. It is the sweet uncertainty that makes my chase for answers so much more rewarding. I admit that I am often wrong and pedal forward to answer the timeless question: Why?\n\n",

      "essay": "Entering my kindergarten classroom, I shuffled around my blueberry shaped classmates as some began throwing their  winter layers into cubbies.  Admittedly, my torso was equally bulbous – covered with the threats and extortions of my mother: a heavy jacket, gloves, and a hat. But, below the waist I wore only a pair of frigid khaki shorts. As I walked proudly to my seat, my teacher quickly approached me. Bug-eyed, in what I assumed was intense admiration, she asked “Stephen, aren’t you the tiniest bit cold?”.\n\n“No,” I replied, smiling. “I don’t get cold.”\n\nFor as long as I can remember, those words were my battle cry. Everyday, I endured questions from playground supervisors, taunts from my classmates, and concerned looks from parents.  But, everyday I stood my ground, refusing pants on principle.  I would  never wear pants. I would never  conform. I would never ever be cold.\n\nTen years later, on a non-descript winter morning, I woke up shivering. Moving mechanically to my khaki drawer, I felt my legs cringe at the prospect of another “pantsless” walk to school. My boundless heat had left with elementary school, but my identity hadn’t. I was fifteen now, often miserable, but unable to do what felt like a betrayal of the past nine years of my life. Pausing to open my khaki drawer, I noticed a pair of jeans neatly folded on top.  Looking out my frost lined windows, I clenched my jaw and decided.  Gingerly, as if afraid of some microbial contagion,  I picked up the jeans.\n\nPutting on pants was not a moment of gleaming insight, but the beginning of an understanding. I realize now that every day I’d stubbornly worn shorts under the banner of “being myself,” I had not been preserving who I was, but who I had once been. By spurning pants, I had chained myself to who my past wanted me to be: a slave to the errant belief that by changing who we are, we betray who we once were.\n\nWhen I slipped on the jeans, I ended one lifelong tradition and began another: acceptance of the concept that who I am is not a static goal but a moving target. Who we are is not ever to be achieved but always to be chased.\n\nI was always taught to be myself, and as a pantsless blueberry, I took this to mean that I could not let others define me. But, now, as a larger, better-clothed blueberry, I realize the preconceptions we hold of ourselves, the traditions we create, and the dogma we overlook, cage us more effectively than any regime. Though I was unaware at the time, putting on those pants changed my life. I put aside years of tradition in beginning the struggle to question my own assumptions, look at myself critically, and live the changes that I find. For, when it comes to deciding “who I am,” it is not my friends, family, nor even my past self, but I who wears the pants.\n\n",

      "essay": "I sat frozen on the stage. I was at my first major dance performance, at the 2010 Commonwealth Games Opening Ceremony, and my cue had come. Ten seconds passed, and I was still frozen. Twenty seconds. Thirty seconds. No movement.\n\nThis was my performance: keeping my body still as a statue. My role was to use subtle facial expressions to depict the guru-shishya (teacher-student) relationship sitting under the Tree of Knowledge.The piece depicted how teachers impart wisdom from the tree of knowledge to their students.\n\nWith a large bright-red tilak mark on her forehead, eyes outlined with black kohl and a body swathed in Sambhalpuri sarees, my guru brought a sense of other-worldliness to our institute (Shri Kamakhya Kalapeeth) for Indian Classical Dance Odissi. Her love of tradition was reflected in her teachings. For instance, she opposed the use of props and set decorations: if we dancers were truly embodying the story, our expressions and mudras would be enough. Our performances were not for mere entertainment; we served as cultural ambassadors. She never verbally complimented anyone. Approval was tacit, usually indicated by selection for some performance. Some students did not get a chance to perform for years.\n\nSurprisingly, I got my chance rather early. At the age of ten, I was one of the youngest to receive ghungaroos, which are anklets with metal bells that serve as vessels through which the guru confers a blessing onto the student. This was a pivotal point in my journey.\n\nAfter this, I started performing all over India. Whenever I stepped on stage, I got lost in the performance, and for those few moments nothing else mattered. At times, I was called on stage to play several characters in the same dance just through a change of expressions. I started to truly feel the power of pure Odissi to inhabit other characters, and other worlds.\n\nSo much of my energy went into dancing, I found myself involuntarily living dance – painting canvases with dance themes, practicing dance moves while taking phone calls, and even revising steps in my mind during long swim workouts. This was when I realised that Odissi was more than a hobby; it was my passion.\n\nOn my 15th birthday I received a gift I will cherish for life–my teacher booked an auditorium for my Rangapravesh: a debut solo-dance recital. The coming months were intense. I came home exhausted from rehearsals, but my tired feet ached to dance again.\n\nAs the practices got longer, my bond with my guru grew stronger. Then came the penultimate day of practice for my Rangapravesh. After completing one of my longest and toughest compositions, “Dashavatar”, I was going to change my sweat-soaked clothes when my teacher called me next to her. This was odd; usually I would simply be dismissed. With arms wide open she said, “I see my reflection in you.” Trembling, I went closer and hugged her. After nine years of training I had finally received my first compliment.\n\nEver since, I have felt inspired to carry forward the Odissi tradition. In order to preserve my guru’s legacy, I want to immortalize her dance style by using motion capture suits to transfer her movements onto robots. This way, people all over the world can experience the aura and magic of Odissi. Dance has no boundaries, and progressivism is how I perceive Odissi can be preserved. As I embark on university study abroad, I want to be in an environment that is not only engulfed with reverence for knowledge and tradition, but also where I can challenge ideas and craft my own style of teaching.\n\nDuring my dance journey I have learned that education does not emanate passively from a tree of knowledge, but takes hard work, self-motivation, dedicated teachers, and supportive resources. And sometimes, when you are training for a dynamic future, you need to start by sitting still.\n\n",

      "essay": "Mr. Kimmel died of a heart attack the Saturday before school started.\n\nWhile I didn’t know him, former students praised how he made eighth grade tolerable with his tangential dialogues on Star Wars and the power of prose. Announcements deadpanned his passing, a library alcove renamed “Kimmel’s Korner” – his honorable epitaph, which few gave second glances to; I was no exception.\n\nThen, post-funeral reparations: the wise words of Yoda ripped, demeaned, replaced with motivational quotes when Mrs. Wilson took residency. By then I was indifferent toward English. I didn’t care; it didn’t seem like I could care. But months later, Mrs. Wilson told me to enter the Poet Laureate contest; said I had a voice and that it was just unclear and “dripping to scream,” so I wrote a few poems – teenage angst, my great forte.\n\nThrough my bad poetry, it happened. I lost the contest, but I kept writing. It came spontaneously as an overwhelming urge to express my ambivalent feelings – one’s I had never been able to express before. Maybe it was Mr. Kimmel, speaking beyond the grave, motivating me – God knows why. Or, perhaps, I was just wrong about English, because one day I found myself carrying a dilapidated Jane Austen novel to school, cradling it like I would a child. I started to love literature, pouring out these newfound, gooey emotions into flawed but passionate words. I’m actually proud of my work, I thought for once.I wondered about Mr. Kimmel. What his family was doing. How they were doing.  \n\nJust at the brink of high school and pseudo-independence, I received an invitation to an award ceremony for graduates. Sitting down in a big cafeteria, staring at the makeshift podium that, prior to the ceremony, had never unnerved me so, I wanted to crawl out of my skin as I read an event on the program: The Andrew Kimmel Memorial Writer Award. Our family’s camera stopped working when I was called up, but I was too incredulous, too nostalgic, too indulged to notice. Mrs. Wilson smiled sweetly as I collected myself, and then I noticed the elderly woman behind her.\n\nNo need for greetings. The beating of my eardrums deafened the words of the fragile stranger who gave me a kiss and hug and letter, and suddenly I knew who this was. Nervously, I had walked down stage too early, but my heart pounded and I walked back to the woman, braving this moment. She said she read my work, wanted to read more. I forgot the rest. It’s just a giant ripple of adrenaline. At home, I read the letter, thinking about her familial embrace. “We want to wish you well on your future in high school. Mr. Kimmel would be so proud. Strive higher…go for it! Sincerely, Ellen Kimmel Epstein.”\n\nBut what was this it? I never knew Mr. Kimmel, and I didn’t have to. That spirit which reverberates through his sister’s letter alone will always remain with me, a glimpse of compassion, desire, maturity. I know what I want; yet, even greater than that, I realize how badly I want it: to inspire people as Ellen inspired me; to remember Mr. Kimmel not for who he was, but for what he did. The letter vaguely speaks to me of a change I think I see. I’m not stupidly indifferent, because I know a little fraction of my purpose. I can taste it, a droplet on chapped lips, replenishing life if only ephemerally. It’s that rare sustenance which drives me to do something, whatever that something manifests into. I am ready to dive into this passion, wherever it may take me. A pool of words before me, ready to be scrambled into prose, echoing Yoda: “Do or do not. There is no try.”\n\nDeep breath, then jump.\n\n",

      "essay": "Each time I dance I am becoming more of who I am. That is why I adore dance. It is one of my most natural expressions. It is my most authentic response to my creator. I know I am in a relationship with God when I dance before the pulpit. I dance with all my might. Likewise, I debate with that same fervor. I throw down the gauntlet. My mission is straightforward: pillage the other person’s point. Church and debate fill my life with wooden pulpits and iron podiums. From the pulpit comes a message with which the congregation agrees. From the podium, I hear a message where I am expected to offer a resounding retort. In church we nod, sing, clap and dance as forms of agreement. We also celebrate with choruses of “Amen!”, “Alright!”, and “Hallelujah!” However, in debate, it is always my responsibility to listen and to disagree. I hear what someone says and reflexively say the opposite. I have found that polar opposites, agreeing and disagreeing, can actually converge and shape who I am.\n\nMany see agreement as simply leading to conformity. I disagree. Agreement has afforded me the opportunity to experiment with new ideas and formulate deeper understanding. One day, my dance teacher introduced the exercise of meditation. It seemed that most students had meditated before because of their immediate compliance. However, meditation did not fit my personal disposition because it seemed so passive, in nature, to me. Though hesitant, I forged forward. I put aside my disagreement toward the activity and chose to buy in to my teacher’s sales pitch. By the end of our first meditation, I was not totally sold, but I continued. Within a month’s time, I had become a member of a community of meditators. Agreement has led me to deeper relaxation and a more contemplative temperament. This may seem like a simple incident in a high school dance class, but I’m learning that moments between dances and debates can offer great reward.\n\nDisagreement is rarely relaxing, but it has protected me from falling prey to blind acceptance. In conversations with friends, I often hear a word spoken that is now claimed by many to be an embrace of Black culture. I disagree. As generations of people before me, I view this racial epithet as demeaning and vile. Even though it seems to be in fashion, I will not agree to use it in casual conversation. Nor will I get into heated debates in hallways when I hear it. I have learned that disagreement can take the form of a personal standard rather than a constant call to verbal combat. Disagreement, I believe, must be delivered civilly if you want others to hear you. In the case of this epithet, my steadfast disagreement has kept me from using a word that completely opposes my moral code. In speaking up and setting a different personal standard, I have presented a new perspective to some of my peers. As a result, this has somewhat reduced their cavalier use of the word which I consider a turn for the better! I have discovered that I have the ability to persuade others through more thoughtful and authentic communication. I now see the greater benefit that holding to some of my long-standing convictions can reap.\n\nMy greatest desire is to be an intentional force for good, and this internal debate between pulpits and podiums has helped me in becoming that person. I anticipate that there will be some beliefs that I will adhere to, and rightfully so. Conversely, there will be ones I will put aside in order to participate and learn. Being able to dance between agreement and disagreement is what I have discovered I love the most.\n\n",

      "essay": "10:00 AM – Museum of Modern Art (MoMA)\n\n12:30 PM – Lunch at Blacktap\n\n2:00 PM – Wicked on Broadway\n\n6:00 PM – Rockefeller Center and Lego Store\n\nAs the informally designated family vacation planner, I made sure to accommodate each of my family member’s interests along with my personal desire to constantly make the most of each opportunity, which meant that our schedule was always filled to the brim.\n\nAfter a long day of dragging my family through the streets of New York City on a hot day in June, I was eyeing the cheesecake in a bakery window when my mom asked, “So, honey, what was your favorite piece at the MoMA?”\n\nI thought back to the quick two hours we’d spent at the MoMA, the place I’d been begging to go for years, but I realized I couldn’t distinctly remember anything about the museum. It was a feeling of unfounded emptiness that I’d felt all too many times before- the same one that seemed to pervade my entire junior year of high school.\n\nI’d become set on continuing every activity I’d joined over the years while self-studying for extra AP exams and taking on extra tutoring jobs on the side. Time fled and my commitments grew, and I found myself missing my brother’s swim meets and friends’ birthday parties just to keep up.\n\nAs my final summer of high school grew dauntingly close, I found myself sitting in my room one day, gazing at the growing collection of awards I’d accumulated over the years. There was one in particular that stood out: the trophy for winning second runner-up at the 2018 National American Miss pageant.\n\nI’d signed up for the competition out of determination to disprove the stereotype of pageant queens being trademarked for their blonde hair and fair skin. But, looking back- despite tireless months of orientations, interviews, and speeches to prepare- the initial excitement of winning had died down, and the only thing I could truly remember was the diverse and amazing girls I’d met. It’s the friends I made and the stories they shared that make me smile, not the crown.\n\nFrom that moment on, I knew that making my last year of high school truly memorable meant not only pursuing end results but also appreciating the paths to get there and the people that made them possible. Over the summer, I stayed after work to grab coffee with colleagues from my internship and took my family with me on my trip to the national championship of my debate tournament.\n\nAnd as the school year approached, instead of spending evenings hidden in my room, trying to get ahead on an article I’d been writing, I laugh and chat along with the rest of my family after dinner. Following a particularly difficult physics exam, I head to a local bubble tea shop to play Uno with some friends to relax (although that can be more intense than the exam itself). Just these seemingly small changes have made school both less stressful and more rewarding.\n\nHalf a year later, I headed back to the MoMA. As I’m writing this, I’m sitting at Café 2- sipping a latte and overlooking the sculpture garden. After an entire day allotted to studying and learning about a couple of the exhibitions in the museum, I can undoubtedly say that my favorite piece I saw was Frida Kahlo’s “Fulang-Chang and I”: a reflection of Kahlo’s strength through a difficult time, grounding herself in her artwork and relationships.\n\nThrough my time in college and beyond, there’s no doubt that I’ll keep myself busy- going from an Economics seminar to volunteering at the library, and then from dance practices to working on my own startup. But I’ll make sure to enjoy each moment; rather than trying to fit 30 hours into a day, I’ll fully appreciate the 24 hours I have.\n\n",

      "essay": "I sat frozen on the stage. I was at my first major dance performance, at the 2010 Commonwealth Games Opening Ceremony, and my cue had come. Ten seconds passed, and I was still frozen. Twenty seconds. Thirty seconds. No movement.\n\nThis was my performance: keeping my body still as a statue. My role was to use subtle facial expressions to depict the guru-shishya (teacher-student) relationship sitting under the Tree of Knowledge.The piece depicted how teachers impart wisdom from the tree of knowledge to their students.\n\nWith a large bright-red tilak mark on her forehead, eyes outlined with black kohl and a body swathed in Sambhalpuri sarees, my guru brought a sense of other-worldliness to our institute (Shri Kamakhya Kalapeeth) for Indian Classical Dance Odissi. Her love of tradition was reflected in her teachings. For instance, she opposed the use of props and set decorations: if we dancers were truly embodying the story, our expressions and mudras would be enough. Our performances were not for mere entertainment; we served as cultural ambassadors. She never verbally complimented anyone. Approval was tacit, usually indicated by selection for some performance. Some students did not get a chance to perform for years.\n\nSurprisingly, I got my chance rather early. At the age of ten, I was one of the youngest to receive ghungaroos, which are anklets with metal bells that serve as vessels through which the guru confers a blessing onto the student. This was a pivotal point in my journey.\n\nAfter this, I started performing all over India. Whenever I stepped on stage, I got lost in the performance, and for those few moments nothing else mattered. At times, I was called on stage to play several characters in the same dance just through a change of expressions. I started to truly feel the power of pure Odissi to inhabit other characters, and other worlds.\n\nSo much of my energy went into dancing, I found myself involuntarily living dance – painting canvases with dance themes, practicing dance moves while taking phone calls, and even revising steps in my mind during long swim workouts. This was when I realised that Odissi was more than a hobby; it was my passion.\n\nOn my 15th birthday I received a gift I will cherish for life–my teacher booked an auditorium for my Rangapravesh: a debut solo-dance recital. The coming months were intense. I came home exhausted from rehearsals, but my tired feet ached to dance again.\n\nAs the practices got longer, my bond with my guru grew stronger. Then came the penultimate day of practice for my Rangapravesh. After completing one of my longest and toughest compositions, “Dashavatar”, I was going to change my sweat-soaked clothes when my teacher called me next to her. This was odd; usually I would simply be dismissed. With arms wide open she said, “I see my reflection in you.” Trembling, I went closer and hugged her. After nine years of training I had finally received my first compliment.\n\nEver since, I have felt inspired to carry forward the Odissi tradition. In order to preserve my guru’s legacy, I want to immortalize her dance style by using motion capture suits to transfer her movements onto robots. This way, people all over the world can experience the aura and magic of Odissi. Dance has no boundaries, and progressivism is how I perceive Odissi can be preserved. As I embark on university study abroad, I want to be in an environment that is not only engulfed with reverence for knowledge and tradition, but also where I can challenge ideas and craft my own style of teaching.\n\nDuring my dance journey I have learned that education does not emanate passively from a tree of knowledge, but takes hard work, self-motivation, dedicated teachers, and supportive resources. And sometimes, when you are training for a dynamic future, you need to start by sitting still.\n\n",

      "essay": "“What can you see?” the lady in the white coat asked me.\n\n“E,” I said, staring at the biggest letter on the top of the eye chart.\n\n“Anything else?” she inquired.\n\n“Umm…No,” I shook my head. Everything below the first line was a blur.\n\nThus, at the age of five, I was officially diagnosed with severe myopia.\n\nThe optometrist then shoved a monstrous gadget in my face, repeatedly asking me to read the eye chart while she changed the lenses. Finally, a clear line of letters emerged before me and the world beyond arm’s reach suddenly became clear for the first time. I then received a pair of glasses. Although it was thick and unsightly, it represented a freedom I previously did not have. A whole new horizon opened up in front of my eyes.\n\nMy vision further expanded when my dad introduced me to photography. Equipped with a point-and-shoot camera, I started taking random pictures – the sky, a frog, a mountain range. For a kindergartener, being able to see the world through a different lens was a fresh and exhilarating experience.\n\nAs I grew older, my photography evolved in complexity and meaning. In high school, I worked and saved enough money to buy a DSLR, a Canon Rebel, with which my art began to take on a more abstract direction, incorporating variables such as focus, lighting, and perspective. In one of my first projects, I put together several pieces of bent paper to form a structure, which took on the appearance of a grand palace when light shone on it at a certain angle. In another, I juxtaposed a seashell and a potato chip, illuminating commonalities shared by vastly different objects. My vision of the world grew as my photography transformed from the mere recording of photons to an art form.\n\nI began to enter and win photography competitions, and one of my works was published in a book, one featured at the University of San Diego gallery, and another at the Calabasas Teen Arts festival. The highlight of my “career” was the day the mayor of Calabasas handed me the award for best photograph, emphatically stating “Great work. It’s so real I could almost touch it!”\n\nStationary photographs transformed into moving images when I took up cinematography. One of my earliest films was an educational video about macromolecules, which launched my YouTube channel. With encouragement from my peers, I made several other short films on a variety of topics, ranging from a Western-style duel to a metaphorical story about self-discovery. For my school robotics team, I created a film utilizing a helicopter, a steadicam, and a rotating platform. My work won 1st place at the VEX online challenge and advanced our team to world championships.\n\nTo date, my most ambitious film project has been an anti-war documentary centered on the experiences of a Vietnam War veteran. This piece was the product of my summer study at the USC School of Cinematic Arts, which introduced me to the wonders of modern day filmmaking. During my interview with the veteran, I had to ask deeply personal and often uncomfortable questions involving the horrors of war and its aftermaths. Memories of killing a 14-year-old boy, losing fellow soldiers, and suffering from PTSD came bubbling to the surface. This project was unlike any of my others, for it challenged me to find new ways to pursue knowledge and, in the process, broadened my sphere of awareness.\n\nDorothea Lange once said, “The camera is an instrument that teaches people how to see.” Indeed, the camera is a medium which has enabled me to see clearly and allowed me to learn about humanity in greater breadth and depth. My biological eyes no longer limit what I can see.\n\nI have found my place behind lenses.\n\n",

      "essay": "After a grueling scrimmage, I trudged off the muddy field with helmet in hand. As I wiped a bead of blinding sweat from my temple, I saw it: “SAND-N******” hastily painted across my locker.\n\nWhen I moved from Bangladesh at four-years-old, I was welcomed — well, tackled — by American football in all its Texan glory. The organized chaos of expressive grunts and collective roars from the sidelines needed no translation; everyone spoke the same tongue under the Friday Night Lights. I felt at home — protected, even. Now, looking at the jagged blood-red letters dripping before me, the locker-room suddenly felt like a war zone rather than the sweaty sanctuary I once cherished.\n\nAfter the incident, I sat alone on the empty benches, feeling dejected and disillusioned as I waited for my parents to pick me up. Should I tell Coach? Unsure of how to respond without causing further conflict, I kept my head down.\n\nA few weeks later, a heavy afternoon rain washed away my disillusionment, leaving compassion in its wake. After my post-practice trek back to the locker-room, I noticed my teammate Kevin slouching in silence as he peeled off his mud-stained jersey.  Contrasting his usual loud energy, his eyes instead sunk dolefully to the ground. Initially, I was hesitant to risk something worse than letters painted on my locker. Potential conflict aside, I couldn’t ignore his visible pain, and reflexively asked him what was wrong. Through angry stutters, he slowly revealed his story: his father was absent, his mother drug-addicted, and he was struggling to care for his six-year old brother.\n\nHis story resonated with me. I told him about how I too had to care for my brother as my father sought medical treatment abroad and my mother worked to keep us financially afloat in his absence. I urged him to carry the leadership and persistence he demonstrated on the field into his own household, focusing on his strengths rather than his flaws. For the first time since the incident, he looked me in the eyes. His softened gaze said it all; empathetic communication can bridge even the widest gaps. \n\nEquipped with this newfound awareness, I approached James – the teammate responsible for painting those divisive letters on my locker – the following Friday night. After a tough loss, we were the last two in the locker-room. \n\n“I’m not mad at you,” I said, puncturing the tension. He looked at me.\n\nHoping that my own vulnerability would encourage him to share the reasons for his actions, I opened up about how my family and I had been subject to similar racially charged attacks for years. I told him how my mother, in a post-9/11 America, was forced to remove her hijab in order to find employment. \n\nHearing my struggles, he felt compelled to reveal his own. His father, an African American, was shot by a white officer before he was born, preparing him for a life painfully aware of any potential racial tension. I recognized his aggressive actions were driven by fear rather than genuine resentment. Through sharing my story and finding common ground between us, I showed him that our differences were merely surface level.\n\nAlthough I decided to hang up my helmet the following year, I carry my locker-room lessons with me everywhere I go. From how I resonate with judges through humanized debate arguments to how I connect with film audiences by composing relatable scripts, I use vulnerability to bridge divides within every field (pun intended).\n\nCommunication is a contact sport. The locker-room is simply a microcosm of our society. From helmets to hijabs, to improve our world we must actively seek to understand each other and embrace our commonalities. After all, we’re all on the same team.",

      "essay": "I opened the door to reveal a scruffy 6’2” millennial wearing bright thrifted clothes and a contagious smile. Was this the man who was supposed to teach me Beethoven? It turns out he wasn’t. Jerred was a jazz pianist and anything but a traditional music teacher.\n\nAfter four years of classical piano lessons, my technique had improved but I found my interest in a steady decrescendo. Although Mozart’s sweeping requiems and Chopin’s delicate etudes bring my mother to tears, my apple fell farther from the tree. By my freshman year, I knew I desired freedom of expression. What I didn’t know was that the fast-talking, bike-commuting, anime-watching jazz pianist standing awkwardly in my doorway would rekindle my passion for music.\n\nDespite having little in common, I grew fond of Jerred’s quirks and looked forward to our lessons. From Joseph Kosma’s “Autumn Leaves” to Charlie Parker’s “Ornithology,” we spent our weeks reviewing the jazz classics as I steadily grew familiar with the genre. I began to transition my skills from sight-reading to chord building and from repetition to improvisation. The more I learned, the more liberating music became. Rather than being confined to the sheet music of celebrated composers, I had become a composer myself. \n\nWith a newfound passion for music, I tried my hand at singing—emphasis on tried. My first musical breakthrough occurred in eighth-grade history class when I rapped about the Founding Fathers for extra credit. To my surprise, the class erupted in laughter and even the teacher applauded my wordplay. While a Jewish private school student is by no means the most conventional rapper, I found I had a surprising talent for Presidential rhymes. \n\nArmed with yet another musical perspective, I spent countless hours composing, and before long, teamed up with my best friend and guitarist Daniel. We spent the better half of Summer ‘17 producing original rap music for our first album: Downpour.\n\nWe lost track of time as we fiddled with our instruments and experimented with new sounds. Despite many nights spent laughing away at the YouTube Recommended tab, we managed to release Downpour in August. Soon enough, the line “bring your umbrella fella, ‘cause it’s gonna be a downpour” became the anthem of our school’s hallways.\n\nWe settled on the band name Subpar at Best to show that—at the very least—we recognized our amateur status. In hindsight, the name was a pretty accurate description of our first album. It wasn’t terrible, but it surely wasn’t winning any Grammys. From the grainy production to the mediocre lyrics, I was disappointed in the end result. Although our classmates were enthusiastic, I felt then as if we had wasted our precious summer.\n\nDespite my initial hesitancy, Daniel and I returned to make music the following summer. We upgraded equipment and even lined the walls of an old closet with egg-crate foam to craft a makeshift recording studio. We managed to refine our sound by better layering our tracks and recruiting talented vocalists. I also challenged myself to establish characters through thoughtful lyrics and cohesive narratives. Ultimately, I was much happier with our second album.\n\nEven still, we improve with every new release. We continue to develop our music and ourselves by seeking out and exploring new genres to fuse with our ever-evolving sound. Much like my transition from classical to jazz piano, our music has shifted from rap to indie rock. No matter the genre, I’m fortunate to be writing lyrics and arranging chords, and that Jerred imparted me with the skills to make music of my own. Producing music has taught me that even when stagnancy settles on the keys, it’s always possible to branch out and try a new approach. I’ve learned to never settle for subpar at best.",

      "essay": "It was Veteran’s Day, and my kindergarten class was listing family members who had served in the military. I raised my hand, waving it intensely, intent on sharing mine. Regardless of the lack of honesty in my statement, I went for it. “My grandpa was in the army.” I needed an explanation for his absence, so my imagination filled the void where truth didn’t exist. He was now a soldier, a hero. Still, my statement was untrue.\n\nCambodia: My parents would romanticize it. And I would listen. It was a beautiful place, dotted with stone temples, rice fields, and water buffalo. My dad would tell me of when he sat on his water buffalo, tending to the crop, climbing trees for coconuts, and taking the occasional nap. My mom would tell me of her bicycle ride to school and her trips to the market. An image of a tranquil, green, Cambodia, filled my mind.\n\nAt age 12, this image was shattered. My mother’s voice pierced my ears, revealing all. For years, my parents hid the chaos that the once peaceful land endured: War, Violence, Instability. They hid the hunger, loss, and pain. They hid the regime that chased away its own children, choking its own people with soulless hands. They hid that at my age, my father ran from home to a refugee camp in Thailand. They hid that at my age, my mother struggled in constant hunger. They hid, that for years, death hungrily floated above my grandparents, aunts, and uncles. Never will I truly know their struggle, but that was their intention: I will never truly know their struggle.\n\nWhen I was born, my parents made a promise, stating that I would never be exposed to the things that they were, that my aspirations would never be cut short by hunger or war. America would be our safe haven, and they sought to make the best possible present out of the past that they were given. For me, they bore a huge burden. For me, they worked tirelessly.\n\n“Work hard, son.” My mother had repeated to me. My parents seemed to live by these words themselves. “Work hard.” At first, I did not pay them much attention, but that soon changed. One day in second grade, I missed the school bus. An unconcerned seven year old, I walked back home. After I knocked on the apartment door, my mother opened it in surprise. Realizing that my dad had gone to work and that she had no other way to take me to school, she grabbed me by the hand, and we began a seemingly endless trek to school.\n\nWhen we had arrived inside the school building, she looked at me. Her eyes housed neither disappointment nor shame. Her voice sounded fulfilled, as it said the same words in Khmer that she had told me for years: “Work hard, son.” She began the long walk home. It wouldn’t be until later that I realized the importance of those words. They were the reason why we were here today. They were the beginning of a cycle: Use what you are given. Do what you are able. Live well. Strive for better.\n\n“Work hard, son.” On my first day of my senior year, my mother hugged me, and said the same words that I’d heard for so long. I smiled, and I listened to those words gently echo inside of my head. “I will,” I promised.\n\nMy parents did not deserve to go through life as they did, but because of their sacrifices, they made sure that I was given all that they could possibly give. They made sure to give me the ultimate present: the present. With it, I’ve been entrusted with the challenge of building the best possible future, and I gratefully accept this challenge.\n\n",

      "essay": "Once the lyrics started, my eyes had no chance of holding back the eager river of tears. B.o.B’s song “Don’t Let Me Fall” spoke to me deeply and immediately. It was the same morning I left the 2013 Mu Alpha Theta National Convention (the largest nationwide math competition), and upon the suggestion of my best friend Andrew, I listened to what he claimed would summarize our experience in a song. Every friend I made, every trophy I won, every game I played, all coalesced in my mind as I reminisced about what I instantly realized was the most jubilant week of my life. Never before had I experienced such a sharp pang of nostalgia, feeling just as blissful as I did melancholy.\n\nMath chose me. Around the age of nine, I grasped the concept of special right triangles while staring at shower tiles. To this day, I habitually multiply numbers in my head, even when I sprint in a track meet or write an English essay. Independent of my math instinct, I possess a healthy competitive energy. Whether I dash down the Ultimate Frisbee field or race through Mario Kart courses, winning becomes more important than breathing. For me, the math competition is the perfect game. It satisfies my craving for challenge while encompassing my most natural instinct.\n\nAs intense as my zeal for math was, a more vibrant humanizing aspect slowly seeped into the experience. I noticed a steady change in how I spent my time at math competitions. I spent less time rechecking problems after the tests ended, and more time making sure I got to meet up with every friend I would otherwise never see. Math never decreased in importance, but became gradually overshadowed by the growing need to organize pick-up basketball and football games with other students in my free time. At the National Convention, I can always count on finding Hawaii’s Ka’iulani gossiping about her YouTube obsession, Tallahassee’s Jessie exuding her unmatched appetite for sports talk, and Seattle’s Tim enjoying crazy card games until the brink of curfew, all under one roof. Undoubtedly, many people enjoy the company of friends they seldom see. There are plenty I have not talked to in years, but here something different motivated me.\n\nMaybe it was the camaraderie of spending time with people who inexplicably subjected their brains to more thinking on the weekends, or simply the fact that seeing each other was rare. Perhaps, though, our community most profoundly resonates from the unconscious thought that deep down, we shared some mathematical enlightenment. They, too, have seen the Pythagorean theorem’s relevance in the distance formula, and they, too, have comprehended the logic behind otherwise mindless area equations. Somehow, it felt as though we were all connected long before we met.\n\nSan Diego’s National Convention perfected my recipe for happiness: doubling the number of States I had friends in, threatening to overflow my trophy shelf (the family piano), and teaching me that math had far deeper implications than all the awards eventually only I would remember. My high school years have taught me to befriend my competitors, rather than alienate them. The tools and opportunities I have been blessed with, along with this lesson, have helped me build a confident identity for my adventures on the horizon.\n\n",

      "essay": "I step through the silence towards the metal doors, bathed in the fluorescent glow that accompanies me to my destination. The air gets colder. I stare at my breath, now a cloud, and move through the stale, unflattering light onto the platform. The pure white dome beckons to me–silent, promising–and I step inside. Admiring the giant in the room–a solitary, intimidating block of metal and glass–I know it is my friend. Life floods in, and as the roof splits in half, my lonely, dignified giant swivels on its mount, letting me peer into its eyepiece. Smiling at the sparse walls of the William and Mary observatory, I feel myself shift from observer to researcher-the transformation I live for.\n\nEver since kindergarten, I can remember deep slumbers giving way to giggles and whispers, sleepy shoe tying, and grass-soaked backs at 1 AM. First came the knock at my door, then the sweet anticipation of another meteor shower as I capered down the stairs into the yard. Against the backdrop of the Milky Way, shooting stars flew everywhere. I asked so many questions, I often fell asleep mid-sentence: “Why didn’t they touch down in the yard? What makes them so fast? Why do there have to be clouds? They ruin everyth-” …out cold and carried to bed by dad. The next morning at breakfast, I would create lines of shooting stars with my Cheerios on my placemat of subatomic particles, and chatter incessantly about burning hunks of rock in the upper atmosphere. Who could blame me for falling in love with the Universe?\n\nAs I progressed through school, I became enchanted by the mystery of distant galaxies, constellations, and nebulae- all things out of this world. I pored over The Astrophysical Journal, A&A, even old Sagan manuscripts. However, I remained a bystander; a stargazer- until my summer trip to Oregon for a visit with family. The planets shifted.\n\nI can still feel the dust thick in the air; hear the whirring, chewing and grinding of machinery around me. My uncle, an avid woodworker, was showing me the ropes of his impressive shop. He caught me staring into space, and asked, “So what do you love doing, Tanya?” “I like looking at stars,” I replied, without missing a beat. “Just looking?” he replied. “You know, thinking is wonderful, but making an impact is even better.” It was as if his words awakened me from a trance. “Can I see those goggles?”\n\nSuddenly, I had an irresistible urge to begin building.\n\nIt was not enough anymore to love the stars all by myself-the wonder was too grand a gift to keep. I had to share it. So, I applied all I knew, and created a program that enables amateur astronomers to inexpensively analyze emission spectra of stars with pinpoint accuracy. To my delight, it was nationally honored at the Junior Science and Humanities Symposium, and has also been implemented as an instructive tool for the Williamsburg Astronomy Society.\n\nWorking in the observatory, I was able to take photos critical to the testing and troubleshooting of my program, specifically optimizing error reduction and evaluating the negative effects of photo exposure. But more importantly, I discovered my calling–the formalized poking and prodding of scientific research.\n\nMy experience at the observatory also motivated my past summer at the High School Honors Science Program (MSU). During seven weeks of snack-filled, seemingly eternal nights, I theorized an efficient and versatile quantum electrical component, and so advanced the future of high power computing. I hope, one day, to help perfect the tools with which we study our precious Universe.\n\nDebugging code and fiddling with focus knobs, I discovered my place in the world–striving to understand the impossible. I will always be the awestruck little girl sprawled out underneath the Milky Way; but now, I observe with the spirit of a true scientist.\n\n",

      "essay": "As I sat in the one roomed ramshackle, I could tell that the five other individuals with whom I shared the room were fast asleep. The lamp was slowly waning, a true sign that the kerosene was almost used up. Unlike the screams and gunshots that filled the air the previous night, the entire slum was silent. I was frantically trying to piece together the next day’s lesson plan but She was all I could think of. She sat there, perfectly blended with the other kids, all in tattered uniform and unkempt hair. As I entered the classroom with my smelly shoes thanks to the streams of running sewage that I had to jump across with little success, I could feel their anticipation. Despite their physical uniformity, Sheila distinguished herself intellectually. I was a volunteer English teacher at her school. It was my first lesson, yet she’d ask and answer questions without the timidness in the rest of the pupils. Her English was nowhere near perfect but she was never afraid of airing her views. If this were a private school catering for the other half, her character would have gone unnoticed, but Five Star was a slum school housed in a church. It catered for the kids of Kangemi,a slum in Nairobi. Therefore my curiosity drove me to have a tête-ă-tête with her over lunch hour. Mimi sijui mamangu na babangu, nilizaliwa huko kwa njia (I do not know my parent’s, I was born on the street) she said after I inquired about her family. Her jovial mood slowly turned into a solemn one. I felt guilty for having made her feel sad. I now saw her in a different light. Behind her demeanor of a confident child, lay a child who had been abandoned by her mother, picked up by a good Samaritan and raised in the slums. Behind her smile was a young girl who apart from doing her homework after school also had to help her foster mother go buy water miles away then come back and cook dinner. Nataka kusaidia ‘mamangu’ na watoto wake(I want to help my foster mother and her kids) She said in a shaky voice, citing this as her main reason for taking her academic work seriously. She went ahead to tell how she had to stay at home most of the time so as to help her foster mother take care of her kids. How she was sometimes forced to go to the street and beg in order help her ‘mother’ feed the family. After the chat, as I watched her walk away gracefully, I could feel tears build up in my eyes. Throughout my high school course,I had read Fitzgerald and Wole Soyinka, listened to recorded speeches of Theodore Roosevelt and Obama and read about Mandela, but none of these had had such a profound impact as Sheila. I was moved, not only because of Sheila’s fortitude, but also because I saw myself in the girl. Just as I, she had great ambitions. She was determined not to let her social and economic circumstances dictate how far she could go in life. Most importantly, she was a person working hard, not only to better her life, but also that of those around her. I had come all the way from Ebusiekwe with a view to imparting knowledge to these kids, instead I ended up being inspired. She represented an entire group, of forsaken individuals whose spirits refuse to be broken. That night, as I struggled to make a lesson plan, I kept in mind that I had to do this for Sheila. If she would attend school the next day, then I was determined to make sure that her time wouldn’t be wasted. As the wind blew, a sign that a storm was imminent. As the lamp flickered and the room became much colder, I wrote and rewrote. For Sheila.\n\n",

      "essay": "“Why do you think that happened?” my research mentor probed. His disheveled waist-length hair rustled as he nudged me to respond.  Round, purple glasses tinted his vision, yet I felt he was staring deeply into my soul. His fingers tapped to the jazzy beat of the psychedelic Sly and the Family Stone song streaming from the vintage loudspeakers on his desk. The laboratory room was a symphony of funk rock, humming thermo cyclers, swirling flask shakers, and beeping PCR machines.\n\nWe were hunched in unison over the bacterial culture tubes that I had grown during the day. “RIP Pseudomonas 08/13/14-08/13/14” I had scribbled in my notebook. Lysed clumps of white DNA danced through the liquid growth medium as the professor swirled the contents of the Klett flask.\n\n“So, why do you think that happened?” he repeated.\n\n“I have no idea”, I naively but definitively responded.\n\nOne thing I had come to know was that the answer could almost certainly be found in a book. I could traverse the world, help Scarlett deliver Melanie’s baby in Gone with the Wind, time travel through Asimov’s End of Eternity, and tame giant sandworms in the sweltering heat of Dune. If I wanted to know about chemistry, there was Pauling’s The Nature of the Chemical Bond.  If I couldn’t find books in print, I could easily find them in online databrs. Surely, anything and everything could be found in literature. I would spend hours, ears plugged, clicking away at the computer, reading paper after paper, and attempting to identify exactly what I had to do to make the bacteria grow. This time, I found nothing.\n\nThrough his purple glasses, my mentor saw the problem differently. “You have to start somewhere, Leila. Sure, the publications will give you some help, but science is more than following instructions on a manual.” He was Zorba the Greek, ready to explore any problem by testing and experimenting, while I stubbornly continued to munch monotonously away at my literature.\n\nWeeks passed but to no avail, and I finally decided to get off the desk chair.  “Glad you decided to join the party”, Dr. Myers joked. “The Right of Spring” boomed from the speakers, beckoning a shaky, yet promising new start. The first couple of trials in which I had manipulated aeration to measure its effect on bacterial growth were unfortunately unproductive. After school, I would hastily drop my backpack to the floor and rush to the incubator at the back. Did they grow? Lifting the flask from the chamber, my anticipation sunk to disappointment as the white DNA swirled mockingly to my frustration.\n\nI asked myself “Why did this happen?” This time, however, instead of excavating mammoth piles of articles and books, trying to prove why the cultures didn’t grow, I sought to test different combinations of variables, build upon the data I collected and develop an accurate and precise method for promoting growth. There is no one specific answer to “why did this happen?” that can be found in a book, because the real world cannot be contained in words. As a scientist, I can only design and test models that come infinitely close to the asymptotic nature of truth. Pathways, developing drugs, or designing therapies that will ultimately improve human health. As for now, I continue experimenting, never forgetting that the answer to a problem is only a test away.\n\n",

However, as first generation immigrants, my family and I have been immersed in the French Canadian culture of Montreal and the American culture of Kansas City.

At heart, I am Chinese like my background, but my childhood is colored by French influences and my adolescence is completely painted with the exuberant American character. As a result, a lot of my life has been categorized by my three countries and cultures: the languages I speak, the habits I have, and the aspirations I dream.\n\nMy college track, as of right now, is to double major in economics and mathematics while also minoring in French, but my ultimate goal is to make a positive and memorable impact on the world. Every subject field has a direct lineation to my different cultures, and the most obvious is my interest in French. While it may sound silly, I feel beautiful when speaking such a beautiful language, and I aim to further develop my linguistic foundation through a minor and studying abroad. My love for mathematics is most primarily rooted in my Chinese culture, as my father’s enthusiasm about little mathematical tricks is contagious. Finally, the opportunities and the boldness I find in American culture are best epitomized in its economic landmark: Wall Street.",

      "essay": "If you were wondering how to pronounce my name, it's [Name Redacted]. My name, unlike more common names I come across, isn't typically engraved on keychains sold at gift shops or stamped on the side of Coca-Cola bottles.\n\nFor much of my early childhood, I struggled to appreciate my wonderfully unique name. At playgrounds and classrooms, other kids teasingly referred to me as [Name Redacted] because that's how they remembered my name. While equal parts clever and fair, it always stung a little any time I heard this nickname. Whenever we had a substitute teacher, I crossed my fingers that they would magically pronounce my name correctly, but as confusion dawned on their face, disappointment crept back in. The mispronunciations were jarring at first, but I became used to the abstractions of my name.\n\nOne day, I had both enough courage and curiosity to ask my parents why they didn't name me something simple, like '[Name Redacted]' Defending their decision, they explained [Name Redacted] had meaning in both Hindi and Arabic, their native tongues. In Arabic, it means \" Gate to Heaven,\" and in Hindi, it means \"Little Prince.\" My parents were immigrants who came to the U.S. for higher education, settling in a country that provided them with newfound freedom. My name marked the beginning of an epoch where my parents could create lives for themselves, eternalized in six letters.\n\nGrowing up in Bombay, a city surrounded by extremes of wealth and poverty, the only acceptable career choices for my father were lawyer, doctor, or engineer. He dreamed of designing the buildings of the future, but his parents explained that an architect made no money. On the other hand, my mother, at the age of seven, was seized from her family in Morocco and placed into a home in France, greeted by unfamiliar faces or ones she hardly recognized. The decision to move my mother to France, separated from her siblings and closest family, was one made by her parents.\n\nI was never handed an ultimatum like the one my father faced, nor unknowingly absent from life- changing decisions like my mother. My parents, rarely given the freedom of choice themselves, wanted to make sure I did. Because I have complete self-direction to pursue any and every interest of my own, I have come to think of this freedom and the way I approach things as the \"[Name Redacted] Technique.\" It is my small attempt to claim both my name and the freedom that comes with it. This privilege of choice is only possible thanks to the wisdom, vision, and diligence of my parents.\n\nIn essence, the \"[Name Redacted]-Technique\" is following the things that I am passionate about and exploring the ideas and concepts most fascinating and foreign to me. It includes pursuing the most challenging and intellectually invigorating courses and vying to succeed in them, from taking a course at the [School Redacted] to self-studying and taking AP exams in the subjects I'm curious about. It includes partaking in activities and hobbies that I enjoy, from joining my school's swim team to hiking the jungles of Kauai. Most importantly, though, it truly represents what I want to do; having the choice to do the things I want brings out excitement and enthusiasm that are true to me.\n\nAs I got older, I began to appreciate my name more and more. Today, I take pride when I hear someone stumbling over my syllables, it gives me the chance to introduce a new word to their vocabulary. I become excited when given the opportunity to explain the beautiful dual meaning of the six-letter word that belongs to me as I learn a new mispronunciation. My name is an integral part of my identity, and I hope to be a person worthy of a name indisputably unique, a name far from generic. After all, I wouldn't be able to follow the \"[Name Redacted]-Technique\" without it.",

It made me become a great communicator, while helping my parents overcome their language barrier.\n\nBeing a communicator has allowed me to lead. When I joined my school’s National Honor Society I was given the opportunity to lead. Applying the skills I used from being my mother’s translator I was able to do what no one else could, make the calls and start the club’s most successful event to date an annual Food Drive at a local Albertson’s, which collects over one ton of food every November. Also developing events like an egg hunt at the local elementary school, a goods drive for the Children’s Hospital of Los Angeles, and stabilizing a volunteer partnership with a local park. I have been able to grow as a leader, who actively communicates and brings parties together, planning events and having them run smoothly with minor issues. For instance, last year there was an issue with the homeless shelter not picking up the food for the food drive. In a spur of the moment solution I managed for club member’s parents to collectively deliver the food. My ability to communicate benefited me allowing me to find a solution to an unanticipated problem.\n\nThroughout the four years I have been in journalism I have led; mentoring younger writers and improving the way the paper operates. Staying after hours, skyping with writers about their articles all helped establish my role as a leader, who is always supporting his team. I have done this while writing over 100 articles, editing tons of pages, and managing deadlines. I learned that while being a leader requires effort, it is the passion like I have for journalism that motivates me to lead in my community.\n\nBeing a leader so far in my life has taught me that I need to communicate, be passionate, and pass on my knowledge helping cultivate future leaders, who can expand and supersede my work.",

      "essay": "I’ve always hated the feeling of clammy hands, the needless overflow of adrenaline rushing through my veins, and the piercing eyes that can see through my façade—the eyes that judge me. I felt like this debilitating anxiety that I suffered through was something I could not avoid when doing the thing I was most afraid of—public speaking. I still felt every sweat droplet run down my skin before each speech, and this anguish never completely dissipated. Fortunately, I learned to moderate my fear in high school when I decided to join the speech and debate program. My anxiety has slowly faded in intensity as I’ve gained certitude and poise with every tournament, and every chance I’m given to speak on behalf of others; this talent has allowed me to be a voice for the voiceless.\n\nOut of all the national tournaments that I’ve competed in, the MLK invitational holds a distinct place in my heart. It was my first invitational tournament in which I competed exclusively in Lincoln Douglas debate. I only had two weeks to prepare myself since it was finals week, while my competitors had upwards of two months to prepare. I was fortunate to break into the final round, as my years of experience helped me to articulate and explain my few arguments more effectively, while also refuting my opponent’s.\n\nI realized that the extent of one’s knowledge is useless if it cannot be made known in a way that is clear to others. I learned that preparation is necessary, but one can be so focused on what they are going to say that they don’t hear the arguments presented. I kept an open and ready mind for various claims and strategies which left me free to adapt to the opponent’s argumentative style each round. This ability to think on my feet has served me well in countless debates, speeches, and presentations. I continuously use these skills to become a better and more active listener in my daily interactions as well.",

      "essay": "My greatest skill is my ability to remember things really well, whether they be minute details or important information that should not be forgotten. Over time, I’ve had a knack for remembering details most people would not even bother to remember, such as old test scores, atomic masses, and other details involving numbers. My friends have always marveled at my ability to remember all these numbers. When I was in chemistry class, we used the periodic table so much that I soon began to remember the atomic mass of the more common elements, and even the molecular mass of common compounds like glucose or water. One of my best friends, who is undoubtedly the smartest person in our class, even finds it crazy that I can remember all these numbers and always tells me that my memory of numbers is amazing. I also used my memory to learn and remember how to solve the Rubik's cube, which amazes my friends, as they find it to be complex with many different, possible combinations.\n\nThis skill that I have developed, however, isn’t completely under my control, as sometimes I just remember random and irrelevant facts without really trying to do so. I recall one weekend when my eight-year-old cousin was attempting to memorize the digits of pi: I remembered them along with him, learning up to forty digits in just one day. The skill is seemingly natural and not something I have worked hard to develop, as I may be able to use my memory to my advantage, or it can be a disadvantage. It helps when I have multiple tests in one day, or a test with many questions where I have to remember a lot of information, such as finals. Sometimes, however, it is a disadvantage when I remember information during a test that is not relevant to the topic, such as random dates, names, or song lyrics, to name a few. This skill is very important to nonetheless, as it has assisted me all throughout my life in many tests and challenges involving memory.",

Over my years in high school the college center became my 2nd home, where I learned about extra opportunities and triumphed with help from counselors.\n\nFor instance, with help from my school’s college center I applied and was accepted as an LAUSD Superintendent Summer Scholar this past summer. The program selected 15 juniors out of over 450 applicants to work in one of 15 departments, and I was chosen to work for the communications department, which received over 70 applications – making me 1 of 70. Interning for LAUSD at their 29 floor high rise was very eye-opening and exposed me to working in communications alongside seasoned professionals. The opportunity gave me the chance to meet the Superintendent and school board members, who are politically in charge of my education. As part of the communications department I learned how the district operates a network of over 1,300 schools and saw how the 2nd largest school district shares info with stakeholders through universal press releases, phone calls, and the district homepage.\n\nI wrote several articles for the district publication and worked with public information officers who taught me the principles of professionalism and how to communicate to over 1 million people. Recently, I was called from the district to become a part of their Media Advisory Council working alongside district heads, representing the students of LAUSD.\n\nWorking for LAUSD furthered my passion to pursue careers in both communication and education. I have always had a desire to be a journalist and the internship assured me of that. I want to write stories bringing student issues from areas like mine to light. Being exposed to the movers and shakers that control education in Los Angeles has heavily motivated me to become an educator and at some point become a school board member influencing the education students like me receive.\n\nSupport from the college center has spawned opportunities like a life-changing internship and set me on course for a future full of opportunity.",

      "essay": "“Give me liberty, or give me death!”, I proudly exclaimed, finishing up a speech during my first Individual Event competition for Speech and Debate, also known as Forensics Workshop. Public speaking was always one of my shortcomings. During countless in-class presentations, I suffered from stage-fright and anxiety, and my voice always turned nervous and silent. I saw Speech and Debate as a solution to this barrier that hindered my ability to teach and learn. With excessive practice, I passed the tryout and found myself in the zero-period class. All of my teammates, however, joined because they loved chattering and arguing. I had the opposite reason: I despised public speaking.\n\nI was definitely one of the least competitive members of the team, probably because I didn’t take the tournaments very seriously and mainly worried about being a better speaker for the future. Throughout the daily class, I engaged in impromptu competitions, speech interpretations, spontaneous arguments, etc... Throughout my two years on the team, my communication, reciting, writing, and arguing skills overall improved through participation in events such as Impromptu, Original Oratory, Oratorical Interpretation, Lincoln Douglas Debate, and Congress. I even achieved a Certificate of Excellence in my first competition for Oratorical Interpretation -- where we had to recite a historical or current speech -- for Patrick Henry’s “Give Me Liberty, or Give Me Death.”\n\nI decided to quit Speech and Debate because I felt as if it has completed its purpose. After this educational experience, my communications skilled soared, so I could perform better in school, especially on essays and presentations. Leaving this activity after two years gave me more time to focus on other activities, and apply communications skills to them. In fact, I even did better in interviews (which is how I got into the Torrance Youth Development Program) and even obtained leadership positions in clubs such as Math Club and Science Olympiad Through my two years in Speech and Debate, I believe I became a much better thinker, speaker, and leader. Taking advantage of this opportunity boosted my self-esteem and overall made high school a better experience.",

      "essay": "Originally I saw volunteer work as a nuisance. I felt that it was an unnecessary \"requirement\" for college. I felt that someone decided to do volunteer work while in high school and now it has become the norm and is essentially required for college. Once I began to get involved, however, I found a true appreciation for the work I was doing.\n\nI loved helping people and, as always, wanted to challenge myself. I worked at the Bellflower Volunteer center and tutored kids every day available, as well as helping out with large special events put on by the city. I then joined Key Club and made it my mission to attend every single event no matter what; even going to the lengths to walk for 4 hours starting at 5 in the morning (it was still dark outside) for a 2-hour beach clean up. I then became Service Event Coordinator and also made it my mission to have an event every week, while attending all of them, while still working at the Volunteer Center. I also started a tutoring program in math at my school as I really enjoy helping my peers academically.\n\nIt always warmed my heart to see fellow ninjas( our division mascot) at events I had planned, friends and neighbors at Bellflower events, and CSF members at tutoring.I am always willing to help people with anything. If someone needs my help I will stop whatever I am doing to help in any way that I can. Lending a helping hand is an important part of our society; however, a helping hand cannot do anything if the other hand does not reach for it as well. We need to be able to help ourselves first before others can help us. I tried to create a community where I could help people, but also people could help themselves so that there is no reason for anyone to not be able to achieve their goals and aspirations.",

      "essay": "Throughout my childhood, the phrases “get good grades” and “make money” constantly harassed my every waking moment. Life seemed pointless, a never-ending cycle of trying to make more money to create artificial happiness. However, through partaking in my middle school’s ASB, I discovered my love for helping others, and I realized that I wanted to make my life about changing the world and leaving behind a better future for the generations to come.\n\nIn an attempt to live up to this philosophy, I have performed hundreds of hours of community service. From volunteering at a senior home to distributing food to the homeless, there is no doubt that I have made a substantial impact on those around me.\n\nDespite all this, my most significant contributions are the ones that take place every day and are often undocumented. Picking up trash, staying long after my job is complete to help other groups, or even saying, “Thank you. Have a nice day,” to anyone who has provided a service for me are just a few examples. While they seem insignificant, these small actions add up.\n\nHowever, above all, my biggest contribution is building meaningful connections with the people around me and making sure they realize how special and important they are to me and everyone else. In nurturing those who are less experienced, assisting those who are struggling with their emotions or their studies, and inspiring those who have untapped potential, I am not merely applying a band-aid on a wound, but elevating a whole community around me to tackle and prevent ailments the next decades will bring.\n\nYears from now, I will likely have forgotten about my modest academic achievements. However, the memories of seeing someone I had mentored blossom into a strong leader and the smiles and laughter of someone I’ve helped battle through depression will forever be ingrained in my mind.\n\n",

      "essay": "Serving food at school carnivals, embellishing the local marsh, tutoring students after school, and discharging patients at my local hospital were some of the ways I actively supported my city. However, a distinct way of being engaged in my community involved being selected for the Youth Development Program last summer. This organization works with the Torrance Refinery and selects thirty out of hundreds of applicants. The first week of this program involved activities that trained students for college and eventually their careers by making them adept in communication, leadership, and teamwork skills. For the next four weeks, students were assigned a specific job around the City of Torrance and Torrance Unified School District (TUSD).\n\nI was placed in the TUSD Information Technology Department, along with six other students, and we essentially helped deal with technology-based issues around the district. Even though my professional desire incorporates biology and chemistry, I had a compelling interest and math and technology. I gave back to my community by utilizing the technological skills I gained at work. My colleagues and I traveled daily to several schools around the district and assisted in technological advancements: testing network ports and preparing schools for newer phones, imaging and updating new laptops and desktops, and arranging and setting up new computer labs and Chrome book carts.\n\nToday, many people globally use technological and visual aids to assist their education. My summer job also allowed me to make a difference in the education of others. With the faster internet, newer telephones and computers, teachers could instruct more efficiently and students can be educated more effectively, thus improving their academic performance in the future. This program helped me a lot by boosting my teamwork and leadership skills, which will be extremely valuable as I will be pursuing many president/vice-president positions in my senior year. However, this program has allowed me to make a stronger impact on other people rather than myself; I feel delighted that my work in summer will be beneficial to twenty-thousand students across Torrance.",

      "essay": "Although many would say that hardships are the greatest hindrance on a person, my hardships are my greatest assets. The hardships I have overcome are what push and drive me forward. If I had not gone through the failures of my 7th grade year I may have been satisfied as a B or C student. It is easy for us to use our hardships as excuses for not doing work, however, this is a mistake that many people make.\n\nThrough my struggles and failure, I have realized an important truth: I am not special. The world will continue to go on and expect me to contribute no matter what I have gone through. Everyone endures some type of obstacle in their life; what makes people different is how they handle them. Some sit around and cry \"boo-hoo\" waiting for people to feel sorry for them. Others actually take action to improve their situation.\n\nThrough hard work, I have been able to outperform my peers, yet I know there is still room for improvement. The thought of actual geniuses in top universities excited me; I long to learn from them and eventually surpass them, or perhaps enter a never ending race for knowledge with them. I used to live an hour away from school. I would have to wake up and be dropped off at a donut shop at 4 in the morning and then walk to school at 6:30 am. After school, I would have to walk to the public library and stay for as long as it was open then wait outside and get picked up around 9:30 pm. I am reluctant to retell this story; not because I am ashamed, but because it is not important. It doesn't matter what hardships I have endured, they do not determine who I am. What matters is what I have done.",

      "essay": "At the start of high school, I saw nothing but success. From grades to extracurricular activities, everything seemed to be going smoothly. However, as my sophomore year progressed, this wave of success was soon swamped by a wave of disillusionment. I struggled to perform in Calculus and as a Vice-President, but instead of looking for a solution, I looked for excuses. Ultimately, when I was forced to face my two F’s and my lost elections, the world came crashing down. The vision I had meticulously planned out for the future seemed to shatter before my eyes. My self-confidence plummeted to an all-time low. I thought my life was over.\n\nHowever, my response to this failure was what would ultimately determine the direction my life would take. In the end, I made the right choice: instead of continuing to blind myself with a false narrative that cast all the blame off my own shoulders, I admitted to my own shortcomings and used this experience as a lesson to grow from.\n\nIn doing so, I learned to focus on the aspects of my life that I was truly passionate about instead of spreading myself too thin. I learned to face challenges head-on instead cowering at the first sign of difficulty, even if it meant asking others for help. I learned to accept and utilize my own differences to create my own unique leadership style. Most importantly, rather than letting this mistake define me, I ignited a sense of determination that would guide me back on the right path no matter how many obstacles I encounter.\n\nLooking back, this tragic mistake was a double-edged sword. While it definitely leaves a stain on my record, it is also likely that I wouldn’t have been able to find the same success a year later without the lessons I gained from this experience. At the end of the day, while I still grimace every time I contemplate my sophomore year, I understand now that this mistake is what has allowed me to develop into the person I am today.",

But the moment I left home, I would go to a typical suburban elementary school as an average American kid at the playground. I grew up in a unique position which I both love and hate: being a second-generation Filipino American.\n\nI love being a second-generation immigrant. I have the best of both worlds. But I also hate it. It chains me to this ongoing struggle of living under the high expectations of immigrant parents. How could I hate the part of me that I loved the most?\n\nGrowing up, I lived under the constant academic stress that my parents placed on me. Their expectations were through the roof, demanding that I only bring home A’s on my report card. My entire academic career was based on my parent’s expectations. Their eyes beat down on every test score I received. I loved them so much, but I could only handle so much. The stress ate me alive, but I silently continued to work hard.\n\nLiving under this stress is the biggest ongoing challenge of my life thus far. Until last year, I never understood why my parents expected so much from me. Finally being old enough to understand my parent’s point of view, I realize that they set these high expectations in the hopes that one day, all of the pain and struggles it took to get to America will pay off. Since then, I’ve overcome the high expectations of my parents by converting their pressure into a fireball of ambition and motivation, deeply ingrained in my mentality.\n\nThis intense desire to succeed in America as a second-generation immigrant is something that has and always will fuel my academic drive. As the first person in my family to go to college in America, I’ve made it my life aspiration to succeed in academics in the honor of my family-- a decision made by me.",

As I sat in the prickly seats of old tour buses and the bilingual tour guide has silenced himself for the dozens of passengers that have closed their curtains and fallen into deep slumber, I would keep my eyes glued to the window, waiting to catch a glimpse of wild animals and admiring the beautiful scenery that mother nature had pieced together. At Outdoor Science Camp, while most of my friends were fixated on socializing and games, I was obsessed with finding every organism in the book. Nothing else caught my attention quite like ecology.\n\nAs high school dragged on and the relentless responsibilities, assignments, and tests washed away the thrill of learning, ecology was one interest that withstood the turmoil. At the end of a draining day, I would always enjoy relaxing to articles detailing newly discovered species or relationships between species.\n\nThis past summer, I was able to further this interest when a unique opportunity to volunteer abroad caught my eye. Flying over to the beautiful tropical shorelines of the Dominican Republic, I was able to dive into the frontlines of the battle against climate change, dwindling populations, and habitat destruction brought about by mankind, and I enjoyed every moment of it.\n\nWhile everyone was obviously ecstatic about snorkeling in the crystal blue waters, only I was able to retain that same excitement about trekking through knee thick mud and mosquito infested forests to replant mangrove trees. While tracking animal populations, my heart leaped at the sight of every new species that swam right in front of my eyes. Even when it came to the dirty work of building structures to rebuild coral and picking up trash along the beach, I always found myself leading the pack, eager to start and do the most.\n\nFrom this experience, I realized that pursuing the field of ecology was what I could picture myself doing far into the future, and this was how I was going to impact the world.",

I understand that it is a big jump to go from Bellflower High School to a UC in terms of academic difficulty; however, that is part of the excitement.

My cousin, Zechariah needs constant affection and encouragement; his dad passed away at his peewee football game two weeks ago. Every Saturday morning, at Emanyatta, I work with these children. For African American children in my community, traditional school contributes to cultural genocide. Moreover, a stigma has been festering that college might as well be on the moon if you are not an athlete; I reject this mentality and I am working hard to disprove this stereotype that is infiltrating the minds of my young Black peers.\n\nEmanyatta derives its name from the warrior training camp of the Maassai tribe from Southern Kenya, and I see myself in the warriors that we are conditioning each week. This program was designed to provide elementary school students with additional academic support; however, for myself and many of the kids I work with, the group’s warm environment is monumental and serves as a second home. I know from my own experience, pursuing your passion in my community is a battle. Some of my duties consist of teaching second grade “Read Aloud, Read Proud,” which allows students to practice reading orally, leading third grade’s “Solve It Saturday,” a 30 minute math and critical thinking workshop, and bonding with the kids during “My Earth, My Worth,” a gardening workshop that promotes healthy eating. Seeing the students’ eyes light up each week as I work with them dispels the myth that Black children cannot learn; hearing their choral response disproves the stereotypes that Black children do not listen; feeling their collaborative energy dismantles the notion that Black children will not behave.\n\nI know many of the kids outside of the program, and I know that having a surplus of young volunteers like myself would provide valuable mentorship. My success will come from rewriting the narrative for African American youth in my community, and through encouraging them to pursue higher education.",

      "essay": "It was not until my sophomore year, when I enrolled in AP Spanish, that I experienced a fraction of the struggles of a language learner, which is the norm for many of the migrant students at my school. In middle school, only 4% of the students identified as Latinx; Spanish was just another class. However, learning Spanish in a room full of heritage speakers was another ball game. I felt the judgmental stares of doubtful classmates whenever I would attempt to speak. I heard a voice in my head, advising me against asking questions when I was confused. I carried the pressure to understand everything and to be able to execute my knowledge of the language perfectly. Over time, I developed relationships with my classmates which made me feel more comfortable in the class. Their support helped me not only acquire the language, but also the culture.\n\nThat year, learning Spanish was like growing a tree, and the fruits of my labor encouraged me to plant another one, this time it was Japanese. I approached this class differently. No longer was I afraid to speak in front of native speakers. Impressed by how quickly I absorbed the language, my teacher invited me travel to Japan with her AP class, during Spring break. I also had the honor of giving the welcome address at the Prefectural Peace Memorial Museum. While in Okinawa, my host family embraced me, teaching me how to cook a traditional meal and showing me how to play the Japanese koto guitar. Even though I had only been studying for seven months, I was able to build a relationship with this family, who gave me the Japanese Kanji for my name.\n\nThat same year, I started a blog on WordPress, Eliciting Empathy, to promote awareness about global issues. Learning languages has helped me to connect with people from different cultures; it has encouraged me to be open-minded; it has taught me empathy; it has given me the courage to be vulnerable; it has inspired me to travel and learn more than a class or textbook could teach me.",

      "essay": "Junior year, I was elected Vice President of the Puente Club, and I led the Academic Outreach Committee. This gave me the chance to support the new Puentistas, as the older Puentistas had supported me. I formed study groups for the PSAT, SAT, and AP exams; in addition, I organized an academic tutorial phone tree, by core classes, to connect underclassmen who needed support with upperclassmen who had experienced academic success.\n\nSadly, less than 10% of the graduates at my high school go straight to a university. Many students are falling through the cracks; I am fortunate to be a part of a TRIO program; however, many of the students at my high school were not privy to these resources. I felt it was unfair that my peers- some of my closest friends- were not receiving access to the same information.\n\nMy experience in Puente has inspired me to expand academic outreach to marginalized students. One of my friends, an AVID student, and I founded the Young Scholars of Salinas club, shortened to Young SOS, an acronym that often is recognized as a cry for help, save our souls. The purpose was to share college going strategies with the students, who were not in college readiness programs. This club extended the same services as the Puente Club; in addition, I helped to organize a Southern California college trip, so that our peers would have the chance to receive a tour of a college campus. As a young Black girl who has spent her entire life being the minority, constantly adjusting and adapting, I know what it is like to feel unsupported, but I also know what it feels like to finally find a space where you belong; I found that space in Puente, and I tried to create that space in Young SOS. It’s akin to navigating the diverse landscape of australian gambling sites, where finding the right platform is crucial for a rewarding experience. Through the Young SOS club, my independent success is negated if my peers are not experiencing success. I learned that college preparation needs to start early and that those with access to information are charged with sharing what they know with others in their community.",

      "essay": "I went for my first overseas exchange trip at the tender age of 10. I was in Singapore’s National Table Tennis Youth Team, and we were sent to Taiwan to join a tournament. There, I learnt humility. We were used to being the best Singapore had to offer, and yet stood no chance against the paddlers from Kaohsiung’s local. My overall record was 9 losses and 1 win, but my disappointment eventually turned into respect as the Taiwanese paddlers approached us. Their sportsmanship was admirable, and we soon started trading experiences and skill as we trained with each other. At the end of the trip, I walked away with new friends, insights and revelations – the biggest win I could ask for.\n\nIn Grade 9 I participated in 5D4N hiking trip up a mountain in Nepal that changed my entire outlook on life. I vividly recall running only on sheer willpower and mental fortitude alone after the first day, for my legs were too tired to even produce feeling. Midway through, we stopped at a small school that people in a nearby village attended. Learning how the students had to make the two-hour hike up every single day, to and fro, made my heart ache, and the appreciation I have had for everything I had in Singapore has carried on ever since. Upon arrival back in Singapore, trivial matters like a small rain on my way home or the soles of my shoes starting to tear suddenly didn’t matter anymore. Most importantly, I would recall the hardship I faced in Nepal whenever I encountered a problem, granting me the strength to move on.\n\nFrom the cross-country cycling trip in Taiwan to short outdoor exploration trips in Perak to a three-week exchange in Wuxi, China to a solo discovery trip to Sydney, it is an understatement to say that international experiences have shaped the way I think, behave and live. I absolutely cannot wait to share the growth I experienced from every overseas trip, and learn so much more from the melting pot of culture that is California.",

      "essay": "“It’s near impossible, your seniors have tried”, I was told. Zhengyang was probably right. The army was notoriously bureaucratic (proposals had to go through up to 10 commanders) and resistant to change, but seeing my best friend worsen his back injury after 3 back-to-back duties tipped me over. I was determined to change the overbearing 33-hour duty cycle.\n\nDiscussions with the other medics and some brainstorming birthed a solution: cutting the working hours to 28, allowing medics to return home in the afternoon after a 24-hour shift. A blind proponent of the adage “Don’t fix something that isn’t broken”, our direct superior falsely believed that the current system was flawless and disregarded my concern. Unfazed, I refused to wait for something to break and finetuned my proposal before raising it to my Commanding Officer (CO) – a stern man with an eye for detail. Every detail was taken care of – from the breakdown of our workload during a 33-hour shifts to the exact number of people needed to smoothly run the medical centre to contingencies – leaving our CO impressed and persuaded.\n\n“What if our manpower drops in the future?”\n\n“Then instead of all 4 medics leaving only those who were most involved in the after-hours maintenance and running of the medical centre would leave the next day. Those staying in the medical centre will be assigned less demanding jobs.”\n\nI was grilled continuously and regularly by my superiors – thankfully so, for I too wanted a sustainable solution that was only achievable by hearing the concerns of those who were more experienced and knowledgeable. After ensuring that every concern was well-addressed, our CO soon decided to implement the proposed solution, and the comfort of finally being well-rested paled only in comparison to the gratitude and respect I earned from my fellow medics.\n\nThe constant drive for improvement is ingrained deep in me, and my propensity to grow attached to my community simply fuels it. The next chapter of my life will be no different, and I absolutely cannot wait to contribute as much as I can to the UC community.",

      "essay": "Planning a Community-Involvement-Project for a cohort of 200 juniors was as daunting as it sounded. I was appointed leader of the team organizing the CIP for all our juniors, and while it wasn’t my first time organizing an event this one was of the biggest scale by far.\n\nOur progress started smoothly. Utilizing my prior experience, I led fruitful brainstorming sessions and discussions and we swiftly came up with a plan of action: to deploy groups of students to different residential blocks in Bishan for food collection with every team led by a member of the Organizing Team, finally donating all the food collected to a charity.\n\nI still vividly recall the major hiccup. I was in the gym when I received a call a few days before the project was to commence, and was informed that the people in charge of applying for a permit to conduct our project forgot to. I immediately dropped the weights for this new, heavier problem. Wanting to find out for myself, I called the police department and was told what my colleague told me – that permits had to be applied for a week in advance and it was hence too late. Unfazed, I decided to visit Bishan’s police post but knew I could not go empty-handed. Armed with a presentation of our project, a letter of support from our beneficiary, and all necessary paperwork filled, I engaged in an hour-long discussion with the officer on duty. Not wanting to let a genuine mistake get in the way of doing good, the officer finally acquiesced and our project continued smoothly. A few more hiccups presented themselves (like the transport company backing out last minute), but were swiftly settled (I got my uncle who owned a lorry to aid in transport).\n\n“We thought all was lost when we called you” was what my team told me during the after-action review. Smooth seas do not make a good sailor, and I remain immensely grateful for the hiccups that honed my ability to remain calm, my resourcefulness, and my adaptability.\n\n",

      "essay": "I used to believe the common consensus of my classmates: math education beyond elementary level had few applications in real life. However, my perception of math has since changed. It’s not about what you learn, it’s the way math makes you think.\n\nMath is a tool I use to navigate the world around me. In third grade, I learned to think quickly by rehearsing my multiplication tables. In middle school, I explored my creativity by solving math riddles unconventionally. Now in AP Statistics, I sharpen my analytical skill and logical reasoning when designing population studies. Acquiring these skills has its challenges, but I’ve learned to overcome them by developing the right mentality.\n\nPart of the requirement for enrolling in my AP Calculus class involved taking a Stanford online course called “How To Learn Math”. Though it did not teach calculus concepts, the course focused on something of much greater value: maintaining a growth mindset. If one believes they have the capability to improve, then they can, because intelligence is not fixed. With grit and persistence, anyone can achieve the highest levels of math. I was inspired, and wanted to share my knowledge with other students in need of support.\n\nI established “Successful Solutions”, a tutoring club at my high school for students in all levels of math. Along with the tutors I recruited, I work one-on-one with students, making sure they fully understand each step to solving a problem before moving on to the next. By drawing visual aids on the whiteboard such as graphs and number lines, I help students to better comprehend the material.\n\nSeveral students who attend my club meetings are deaf and hard of hearing. The process of communicating with them through sign language interpreters allows me to develop greater compassion and patience in my teaching. I watch students gain confidence as they overcome challenges, find solutions, and acquire skill sets. The rewarding feeling after each meeting fills my heart with satisfaction and shows me how empowering math can be.\n\n",

      "essay": "The rattle of a doorknob pierced the night. It was my grandfather, Yeye. As usual, he was disoriented, thought it was time to eat, and being hard of hearing, required loud convincing by my mom to return to bed. Plaque and tangles had accumulated in my grandfather’s brain, and now they spread into our everyday lives.\n\nWith my step-grandmother suddenly moving back to Taiwan, my family was completely unprepared to care for a 90-year-old disabled man. There were no funds for professional elder care, so my mom, dad, and I had to quickly adapt to accommodate his needs. After a number of falls, we installed safety equipment into the bathroom, which he shared with me!\n\nMy grandfather’s Alzheimer’s disease erased the connection that he and I once shared. When I was younger, Yeye and I used to solve math puzzles together, but now we couldn’t even hold a conversation. As I looked back, I realized he had lived a sedentary senior life. Would a more active lifestyle have led to a different outcome?\n\nI’ve noticed that our American culture glorifies youth but nearly ignores what it means to grow old. So I am developing a mobile app to prepare families for elder care. It will enable users to compare both in-home and outside elder care facilities, provide caretaker support, and promote cognitive health. Brain games will be personalized to exercise memory, like matching the names of family members with their appropriate pictures. I am currently designing a prototype for my app, and I plan to continue building it in college.\n\nYeye can no longer walk. While the challenges have increased, I have learned to appreciate the different stages of life and return the love and care that my grandfather once gave me. With this in practice, Yeye’s disposition improved and he accepted our home as his. I am determined to sort through the tangles of life. So when I hear the doorknob rattle at night, I know it’s just a reminder for us all to make healthier choices today for a better tomorrow.\n\n",

      "essay": "Ding! I had just received an email from my school’s yearbook committee in response to the first draft of my 2018 cover design. “We like the background, but the illustrated academy symbols are lacking originality.” I stared at my design in Photoshop and fidgeted with my stylus pen, without a solution. How could I create a clever retro-themed cover that integrated the visual, theatre, music, and dance academies of my school? I left my computer and went for a walk. Standing beneath my neighbor’s expansive tree, it became obvious that I needed to branch out and find inspiration from artists of the past.\n\nAfter looking at countless works, I discovered that styles from the 1900’s-1920’s resonated the strongest for this project. Finally, I was ready to transcend my own limitations.\n\nReferencing the simple color schemes from the artistic movement of De Stijl, I restricted my palette to shades of red, teal, and primrose yellow. I incorporated contemporary trends and Russian constructivism to transform the numbers “2018” into bold geometric shapes. These were then layered and intermixed with figures, instruments, and artistic tools all influenced by the jazz art of the Harlem Renaissance. What was a “0” had become the lens of a camera, and what was an “8” had become a cello being strummed.\n\nIn many ways, I saw my artwork as a geometry puzzle. Each shape was created in Photoshop with Bezier curves, whose control points I manipulated to stretch along tangential lines. In the background, I created movement with sharp cubistic angles and converging colors that wrapped around the cover. After numerous revisions of many symbols and shapes, both sides of my artistic equation eventually found balance.\n\nThrough research and experimentation, I was able to discover unique ways to combine design concepts, math principles, and my school culture. My efforts were rewarded by winning 1st Place for the Friesens North American Yearbook Cover Contest. Though the honor was humbling, the true prize was in the process.",

      "essay": "The Girls Who Code Summer Immersion Program was a pivotal experience in my education. At no cost, I was selected to study computer science for 7 weeks amongst highly motivated females like myself.\n\nEach day I was grouped with new girls to collaborate on projects and form new friendships. We explored the coding languages of HTML, CSS, Arduino C, and Python (my favorite). I learned to code my own website, program robots to sing the latest pop songs, and create games that my peers could interact with! My curiosity drove me to ask many questions as I was eager to perfect my code.\n\nIn the last two weeks of the program, my team of three girls developed the most difficult project of the class. We built a mobile app with a tracking device to identify the location of one’s valuables. A scrum board was used to prioritize and assign specific tasks to each person. I was in charge of designing the app’s interface, embedding Google Maps, and encoding the tracker’s GPS and Bluetooth data into the app. At times, these tasks felt nearly impossible with continuous errors in my code. However, after doing immense online research and testing several different approaches, I was able to create the functioning features within our app. On graduation day, my team stood on a USC stage and pitched our project to an audience of peers and professionals. Our efforts spent coding in two different languages and long nights overcoming technical hurdles had culminated in this moment of pride.\n\nThe process of developing our tracking app taught me to take risks. I learned to accept that sometimes the best option is just to scrap my work and begin anew. I’ve become more patient and persistent in my coding projects, academics, and art practice because of this experience. Girls Who Code strengthened my ability to transform ideas into reality and inspired my future career path.",

      "essay": "I am a person of the woods, and every summer when I come back from my canoe tripping camp, I have transformed from the city dweller that defines ten months of my year to the wilderness man my friends jokingly call me. Canoe tripping is so much more than carrying a canoe or a pack, or paddling lakes bigger than my whole city; it’s about the people you’re with, the friendships you create, learning about yourself, and your relationship with your surroundings.\n\nI have spent every summer since I was seven at Camp Pathfinder, building friendships with people who were so different than me each year. Pathfinder has a way of bringing people together from different backgrounds, sides of the continent, even countries, and bonding them for life. I have friends all the way across my continent in Los Angeles, friends who I’d never seen before who actually live on my street, and even friends who live in Spain. Going across the trails with packs half our size and more than half our weight, or canoes sixteen feet, you get to know each other well and deeply. My friends range from seven years old to sixty-three. At Pathfinder, everyone is equal and everyone is in the same boat, or canoe for that matter.\n\nWhen I first went to camp, I loved being on the island, but hated canoe tripping. Being forced to carry a pack and traveling by canoe was awful. Where was the fun in sleeping in small tents with an absurd amount of mosquitoes and aching after portaging? I came home crying that first summer, but for some odd reason, I was drawn back. It took four years until, finally, I understood. I went on a twelve day canoe trip and it clicked; I had the time of my life, and I was hooked. Since then, I’ve come to appreciate not only learning about the people I am with, but the environment that surrounds me. The sunsets in Algonquin Park are the most beautiful on Earth, seeing water at the end of an arduous portage feels greater than spying land from the lake, the sound of a loon has an unmatched purity, and the fog on the water draws you to it.\n\nMy friend Aidan has taught me to push myself harder than I thought possible; Tate taught me there is no rest until we have made the trip as good as it can be for the younger campers; Gabe showed me that laughter is the best way out of any situation. From Rohan I’ve learned there is always a solution, and from Grady I’ve learned that it IS possible to encompass all of the ideals that define each of us. From me, they say they have learned leadership, and I hope that is true.\n\nAnywhere I go, I can meet someone with some strange connection to Pathfinder and this common ground alone allows us to talk on a more intimate level, passing the “get-to-know-you” stage of acquaintances. We bond over past staff, mutual friends, canoe trips, lakes in the park, and our beautiful, red, cedar-strip, canvas canoes. Pathfinder has jokingly been referred to as a cult because of the way we religiously worship our “sacred” island. The scary part is, this is true. We worship the canoes that allow us to travel and we thank the great spirit, who constantly watches over us.\n\nIn reality, it is more similar to one large family with thousands who share the one hundred five years of its history. Our days of canoe tripping and pushing each other connects us deeply. When we sit around the fires at the end of the day, we don’t need to talk; we just need to relax and enjoy one another’s company. And as we lay down our heads, on our soft balsam beds, we thank the great spirit that our blood runs Pathfinder red.",

      "essay": "I was first introduced to the world of computer science at [redacted], where through student-led workshops, I learned the basics of programming and its implementations in robotics. Applications were twofold: we used C++ for robot movement and Python for data analysis in alliance-making. Seeing two different programming languages used in two very different ways, yet still contributing to a common goal was inspiring. It is this inspiration that I aimed to pass on as a student mentor myself in my junior year, designing and leading activities, the rookies' curiosity and never-ending questions further driving my passion.\n\nOn the first day of my internship at [redacted], my mentor, [redacted], asked if I knew any programming languages, to which I excitedly recounted my experience with C++ and Python in robotics. Satisfied, he explained some potential projects I could work on, and sent me a book on R, a statistical programming Language his lab used. By the time I started my project, I felt confident in my understanding of R, capable of using advanced libraries and creating beautiful visualizations. As I started tackling problems, however, I quickly realized that the results I was finding were inconsistent and unexpected. Many failed program runs and Stack Overflow posts later, I decided to ask my mentor for help. Slightly amused at my plight, [redacted] patiently explained how code in R was indexed at one, not zero like the languages I was used to. This minute difference, although frustrating, pushed me into exploring complex topics like compiler theory and discrete math to truly understand why that was the case. When I finally completed my project, I felt tremendous pride. Although my program was just one small cog of a much larger machine, it was improving the drug discovery process, and I learned so much along the way.\n\nComputer science has allowed me to become an engineer, prototyping pathfinding algorithms, a chemist, democratizing drug discovery, a teacher, showcasing the power of technology, and so much more. At the UCs, I look forward to seeing where it takes me next.",

      "essay": "I was first introduced to the world of computer science at [redacted], where through student-led workshops, I learned the basics of programming and its implementations in robotics. Applications were twofold: we used C++ for robot movement and Python for data analysis in alliance-making. Seeing two different programming languages used in two very different ways, yet still contributing to a common goal was inspiring. It is this inspiration that I aimed to pass on as a student mentor myself in my junior year, designing and leading activities, the rookies' curiosity and never-ending questions further driving my passion.\n\nOn the first day of my internship at [redacted], my mentor, [redacted], asked if I knew any programming languages, to which I excitedly recounted my experience with C++ and Python in robotics. Satisfied, he explained some potential projects I could work on, and sent me a book on R, a statistical programming Language his lab used. By the time I started my project, I felt confident in my understanding of R, capable of using advanced libraries and creating beautiful visualizations. As I started tackling problems, however, I quickly realized that the results I was finding were inconsistent and unexpected. Many failed program runs and Stack Overflow posts later, I decided to ask my mentor for help. Slightly amused at my plight, [redacted] patiently explained how code in R was indexed at one, not zero like the languages I was used to. This minute difference, although frustrating, pushed me into exploring complex topics like compiler theory and discrete math to truly understand why that was the case. When I finally completed my project, I felt tremendous pride. Although my program was just one small cog of a much larger machine, it was improving the drug discovery process, and I learned so much along the way.\n\nComputer science has allowed me to become an engineer, prototyping pathfinding algorithms, a chemist, democratizing drug discovery, a teacher, showcasing the power of technology, and so much more. At the UCs, I look forward to seeing where it takes me next.",

      "essay": "Peering through the side of the staircase, I observed my parents arguing. Their stern voices were loud, yet the exhaustion plainly marking their faces sent an even clearer message. It was the same argument they’d previously had behind the closed doors that failed to prevent their shouting from reaching my curious ears. I don’t remember what they used to argue about, but I remember how unhappy they seemed. I’ve learned that while people often forget what you said and forget what you did, they never forget how you made them feel. The things we carry as children never leave us; they shape our perspective on the world.\n\nWith this awareness of the abiding influence of childhood experiences, I took upon the challenge to make an impact on the children in my community. A chance encounter with Big Brothers and Big Sisters encouraged me to join a club at school with a similar mission. House of Tiny Treasures cares for children impacted by poverty so that their parents can focus on stabilizing their domestic and financial situations. At length, I became the Vice President of this club, through which I educated members on the psychological effects of early childhood trauma and organized virtual and in-person events for local children. The club president and I planned these events around holidays like Christmas, Thanksgiving and Valentine’s Day because these special occasions tend to foster memories children cherish as they grow older. Working and playing with these kids, I hope that I can make even the tiniest positive impact on their lives. If I am able to put a smile on a child’s face for even a couple of hours, while I know they probably won’t remember the arts, crafts, or singing, I hope the feeling of happiness is a memory they can treasure and take with them through life.\n\n",

      "essay": "As thousands of civilians waited on the docks of Saigon, American soldiers promising safety threw ropes over the sides of their boat. With only their four children and the clothes on their backs, my grandparents climbed up.\n\nWelcomed with open arms by America and the Catholic Church, my family was unimaginably lucky to survive that ordeal and find refuge. I’ve increasingly grown to understand that I am a member of an international community of refugees. A generation ago, with the support of generous institutions and kind strangers, this foreign country became home. Now that my family has established itself on secure footing, I feel a moral and social obligation to use my time and resources to help other, more recent arrivals to this community. Volunteering with PAIR, I mentor middle school refugees and help them with English language acquisition and building social skills in order to foster academic success. Empowered to share my perspective,  I’ve worked with children from Cuba, Venezuela, Afghanistan, and Tanzania, learning about their resilience and courage in the face of adversity along the way. Being only a few years older than my students, I am able to curate personal and insightful relationships with them, while maintaining a position of mentorship. Whether we are tackling difficult social studies assignments or rotating between games of Uno and HedBanz, I focus on fostering a safe environment upheld by support and void of judgment.\n\nServing as a weekly constant for students who are still adapting to the tumult and disruption intrinsic to a cross-continental move, I aim to ease their acclimation into the US and act as their cheerleader for each milestone. As a member of a community that crosses borders, ethnicity, and time, I aspire to create a home built on empathy and support for others, just as others once did for my own family.",

      "essay": "After overhearing a conversation between my classmates about their American Girl dolls, I set my heart on getting my own. That Christmas, I received my very own blonde, blue-eyed doll, but it was not accompanied by the sense of inner security and belonging that I had subconsciously expected and hoped for. My thick black hair, my small brown eyes, and my soft features told the room that I was different before I even had the chance to speak.\n\nI had always known that I wasn’t like my peers, being the only Asian girl in my grade until middle school. Lacking the easy security that came through commonality, I had hoped that if I could successfully suppress enough of myself, then the rest of the world wouldn’t see my differences. Eventually, this misguided attempt transformed into a weight of otherness that chased me into high school.\n\nAt a Big Brothers Big Sisters event, my buddy Amara and I reflected on the chosen topic of self-love. As I instructed her to draw a self-portrait traced with words one might use to describe her, her eyebrows furrowed in distress. I suggested “beautiful,” but she stared at her paper and justified her stagnant pencil by pointing to her darker complexion and tightly-coiled hair. Shocked to hear such self-destructive, yet familiar comments, I urged her not to define beauty through comparison and to search for it within. As her facial expressions softened and she began to smile at me, I realized shared experiences connect people through vulnerability.\n\nA change in perspective is sometimes all we need to conquer our demons. In my case, I realized that the feeling of being different that I had grown accustomed to was not unique to me. Amara showed me that these battles are not meant to be fought alone. With this newfound awareness, I chose to retire my American Girl doll – a symbol of resentment, shame, and suppression. As it collects dust on my bookshelf, it stands as a reminder of my battle to find my identity.",

      "essay": "For a moment, my stressors vanished. The cool, salty breeze swept the hair away from my face. To my right, the still ocean extended to the shores of North Vancouver; to my left, cliffs enclosed the dozens of trails tread underfoot by scores of awestruck hikers. Pushing one foot in the front of the other, I made my way around Stanley Park for the third time. Looking beyond the crystal clear water, picnickers settled on the man-made beach, and the vibrant falling specks of orange and yellow, what I noticed most of all was the cleanliness; the lack of pollution allowed the beauty of the park to speak for itself. Coming from Houston, a city much too hot and busy to bother maintaining sidewalks and parks, the eco-friendly atmosphere inspired me.\n\nAs summer drew to a close and the school year began, my recent experience in Vancouver (a second home to me) motivated me to further investigate environmental sustainability here in Houston. Despite not being selected for my school’s Sustainability Committee, I searched for further opportunities beyond the classroom, and I familiarized myself with The Sierra Club. After several rounds of cold calls and emails, I was offered the position of Student Coalition Membership Chair of Houston — a role that pushed me outside my previous comfort zone of environmental sustainability and expanded my skill set to include engaging with potential recruits, socializing with fellow Houstonians at local events, managing social media sites, and communicating with other chapters across the nation. Through strengthening my networking skills, I was able to simultaneously advance my goal of creating an eco-friendly Houston.\n\nEntering my senior year, I was finally selected to join my school’s Sustainability Committee. I tackled numerous projects such as reinstating the recycling program which had been inexplicably halted during COVID, solving the issue of city fines caused by the student body’s improper recycling, and introducing biodegradable to-go boxes and straws. Collaborating with all sectors of the school, I helped educate students about proper methods of recycling and the real impact it has on our planet.",

      "essay": "As a light-skinned, soft-spoken, empathetic, and analytical Black woman, a lot of times I have felt that I am not a part of my own community. Many of my family members ask me why I relate so much to the East Asian community and culture. This, of course, has led me to question whether or not community is only skin deep.     \n\nI became engrossed in the East Asian community at a young age. My dad, an international pilot, often brought movies home from China. One day he brought home Spirited Away by Hayao Miyazaki. He described it as something similar to Alice in Wonderland. I could truly see myself in the Miyazaki’s heroines: from how they transcended their roles in life to how they met obstacles with resilience and bravery, these heroines helped me feel less alone. \n\nI evolved from watching Miyazaki movies to joining anime clubs, to reading East Asian philosophy, and eventually studying the works of Japanese author Haruki Murakami. This culminated in a trip to Japan last summer as a People to People: Student Ambassador. Immersed in the culture, I visited a Japanese high school, hiked Mt. Fuji, soaked in an onsen, and experienced a deep connection with my homestay family, the Mishimas.  \n\nThrough being a part of the East Asian community, I have explored answers to metaphysical questions, prayed at a Shinto shrine, and realized that community is a state of mind, much more than skin deep.

      "essay": "I probably argue with my grandfather more than I do with most other people combined. It’s not because we’re at odds. We just have different perspectives, influenced by our experiences—his as a life-long resident of India, mine as a first-generation American. \n\nOne pretty common argument we have is over Eastern vs. Western medicine. My solution to a headache, for example, is to take Advil. His is to rub Tiger Balm on his forehead and coconut oil on the soles of his feet. I try to convince him of the benefits of taking a nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory, describing how it can reduce inflammation by blocking the production of certain chemicals. He tries to convince me that the balm creates a cooling effect, distracting the brain from pain and relaxing the muscles. Rather than becoming sore at or resentful of each other, we’ve grown closer through these debates, and I’ve learned how to disagree without letting the situation get acrimonious.\n\nThrough these interactions, I’ve learned that a discussion shouldn’t be confrontational. The purpose isn’t to win, but to share my knowledge with the other party and learn from them as well. So rather than saying, “Rubbing balm on your forehead is stupid; you should just take Advil,” I say, “While rubbing balm on your forehead seems to work, I’ve noticed that taking an Advil has a stronger and more immediate effect.” Respecting the opposing party makes them more willing to hear you out. \n\nI’ve also learned there’s a fine line between logic and emotion. I try not to take personally the things my grandfather says in an argument. Just because he doesn’t think taking Advil is the better solution doesn’t mean he thinks I’m stupid. If I take it that way, we begin to move away from what the argument really was about—the facts. \n\nI’ll continue to apply these learnings in discussions and debates I have with others, realizing that having  a “successful argument” isn’t about winning. It’s about sharing my opinion and learning from theirs, expanding our perspectives without alienating each other.",

      "essay": "Picture this—an edible tortoise-shaped syringe, spring-loaded with a needle to automatically inject a payload of medicine through the wall of your stomach. Horror movie material? Good guess, but no. It’s actually from a study by the University of Toronto. I was exposed to this wacky, creative side of science through the Summer Youth Intensive Program (currently known as the Science for Youth Intensive Program). This program, hosted by UC Berkeley College of Chemistry, consisted of 9 months of weekly virtual mentoring meetings with a Berkeley grad student. While the 4 week on-campus portion was cancelled due to COVID-19, I was nonetheless able to take advantage of this opportunity to deeply study many interesting fields.\n\nSYIP reinforced my love for innovative science. Our research was full of studies that defied conventions. Like removing brain tumors with a straw (to be fair it was a rather complex straw). Or weaving yarn made of human skin so stitches would integrate after the procedure. Or one of my personal favorites, dipping materials in liquid dopamine so they would become, uh, stickier (that’s actually quite a valuable property). All of these graduate-level research papers covered concepts that initially seemed overwhelming. Nanostructure assembly, cancer vasculature, immunology, rotating pigs at high speeds. Quick note on that last one: no, it’s not a joke; yes, it is hilarious. Swine orientation aside, to better grasp these fields of study, I would heavily annotate the papers and research unfamiliar terms. I also compiled any remaining questions to consult my mentor during our study reviews and took ample notes during her presentations.\n\nIn all this research, it was vital that we never compromised on data and testing. After our analysis and critiques, sometimes a brilliant idea would show promise, and other times be constrained by some critical detail. But repeatedly, I found that creativity didn’t necessarily produce pseudoscience. Research can push boundaries in unorthodox ways without ever sacrificing the empiricism that makes science special. \n\nHere's the big takeaway: Sometimes the best solution isn’t the expected one; sometimes it looks more like a tortoise poised to stab your intestines with medicine.",

      "essay": "Following my sophomore year in high school, I was hungry to apply the skills I had learned in calculus and engineering to real world problems. I secured a summer internship with Professor Gurav Sant’s Laboratory for the Chemistry of Construction Materials, a Civil and Environmental Engineering Lab at UCLA. \n\nThe lab’s focus is to make building materials more sustainable. When I joined the lab, their primary project was to design a concrete that can sequester CO2. My individual research project, which aimed to solve a part of the problem, focused on the dissolution kinetics of calcite to better understand calcite stability in cementitious solutions. \n\nI designed and conducted experiments to test calcite dissolution in solutions containing organic ligands including EDTA, citrate, and acetate. My tests were largely unique because they were the first to be conducted in alkaline pH regions due to the nature of cementitious systems. I imaged the surface of my samples with a Vertical Scanning Interferometer (VSI) and analyzed the data with the micro-nano software Gwyddion. My results have applications for breaking down calcite in cement to sequester CO2.\n\nDuring my second summer in the lab, I studied the crevice corrosion of Ti-6A-4V, a titanium-aluminum-vanadium alloy, which has applications ranging from oil pipelines to medical implants. \n\nIn order to characterize the corrosion of Ti-6Al-4V due to the breakdown of its passive film, I applied immersion and electrochemical tests. My experiments were conducted in an artificial saliva solution with fluoride and chloride to understand how dental implants respond to hygiene rinses and toothpastes in a simulated human mouth environment. My results help characterize the inition of crevice corrosion due to harmful anions, which has not been previously studied.\n\nIn my last two years of high school, I’ve been able to start important work that has important practical applications. My research has solidified my desire to be an engineer and let me understand the teamwork that addressing pressing problems requires. In college and beyond, I want to further develop my engineering skills and continue to work with passionate peers to change the world. ",

      "essay": "One Christmas morning, when I was nine, I opened a snap circuit set from my grandmother. Although I had always loved math and science, I didn’t realize my passion for engineering until I spent the rest of winter break creating different circuits to power various lights, alarms, and sensors. Even after I outgrew the toy, I kept the set in my bedroom at home and knew I wanted to study engineering. Later, in a high school biology class, I learned that engineering didn’t only apply to circuits, but also to medical devices that could improve people’s quality of life. Biomedical engineering allows me to pursue my academic passions and help people at the same time.\n\nJust as biology and engineering interact in biomedical engineering, I am fascinated by interdisciplinary research in my chosen career path. Duke offers unmatched resources, such as DUhatch and The Foundry, that will enrich my engineering education and help me practice creative problem-solving skills. The emphasis on entrepreneurship within these resources will also help me to make a helpful product. Duke’s Bass Connections program also interests me; I firmly believe that the most creative and necessary problem-solving comes by bringing people together from different backgrounds. Through this program, I can use my engineering education to solve complicated societal problems such as creating sustainable surgical tools for low-income countries. Along the way, I can learn alongside experts in the field. Duke’s openness and collaborative culture span across its academic disciplines, making Duke the best place for me to grow both as an engineer and as a social advocate.",

A Korean ballad streams from two tiny computer speakers. Pamphlets of American colleges scattered on the floor. A cold December wind wafts a strange infusion of ramen and leftover pizza. On the wall in the far back, a Korean flag hangs beside a Led Zeppelin poster.\n\nDo I consider myself Korean or American?\n\nA few years back, I would have replied: “Neither.” The frustrating moments of miscommunication, the stifling homesickness, and the impossible dilemma of deciding between the Korean or American table in the dining hall, all fueled my identity crisis.\n\nStanding in the “Foreign Passports” section at JFK, I have always felt out of place. Sure, I held a Korean passport in my hands, and I loved kimchi and Yuna Kim and knew the Korean Anthem by heart. But I also loved macaroni and cheese and LeBron. Deep inside, I feared I'd be labeled by my airport customs category: a foreigner everywhere.\n\nThis ambiguity, however, has granted me the opportunity to absorb the best of both worlds. Look at my dorm room. This mélange of cultures in my East-meets-West room embodies the diversity that characterizes my international student life.\n\nI’ve learned to accept my “ambiguity” as “diversity,” as a third-culture student embracing both identities.\n\nDo I consider myself Korean or American?\n\nNow, I can proudly answer: “Both.”",

For a minute. \n\nThat’s a normal night. \n\nYet, I’ve come to appreciate my alone time.  \n\n1:02 a.m.: This is when my most complicated questions come to life. How do we conquer partisanship?

      "essay": "I grew up in a society where discussing sexuality was taboo. Teachers deliberately skipped the chapter on genitalia and childbirth in biology class. So I’d secretly educated myself about sexual health, tiptoeing to fetch my laptop after bedtime and watching YouTube videos under my blanket. Becoming knowledgeable about sexuality and health both excited and humiliated me. Though I knew such education was essential, I often felt like an outcast.\n\nMy struggle to find belonging escalated when I perceived my queerness. In China, employees can be legitimately fired for their sexual orientation and gender identity. Scared of being expelled from school, I forced myself into conversations about attractive actors and pretended to admire the opposite, sex just like everyone else. But I was lonely.\n\nIt was first watching the feminist play The Vagina Monologues in high school that provided me comfort and widened my perspective. Knowing that female sexuality can be discussed – even championed – in public productions amazed me. I came to realize that I was, after all, not alone in the journey of self-exploration.  \n\nMore importantly, The Vagina Monologues opened the door to a wide range of queer media and organizations that offered me a sense of belonging. I finally found my home volunteering at the Beijing LGBT Center. It was the only place I’d seen in China where rainbow flags are hung high and proud, where the house pet is a cat named Duo Yuan (“diversity”), and where the usual response to “I am queer” is “that’s awesome.” From watching Call Me By Your Name with my co-workers to pulling all-nighters collaborating on an interview project to fight stereotypes, I had found my “politically incorrect” salvation.\n\nUsing free time to navigate online queer resources and explore my identity, I did not let this challenge impact my academic achievement, but rather to inspire it. The Vagina Monologues and my work at the Center spurred my interest in Gender Studies, altering the direction of my later academic career.",

At first, I thought I was gay. But I discovered the word “bisexual” and that idea resonated with me.\n\nI was already part of the gay-straight alliance at my school, and I was involved in and organized several efforts to fundraise for anti-bullying campaigns. It took a while to come out to my family, and they had only just started to accept the label of “homosexual” when I dropped “bisexual” on them, and my world flipped again.\n\nThe problem was that, as much as I could be bullied for my sexuality, I at least had friends in the gay-straight alliance. Coming out as bisexual, however, I discovered that even in the GSA, many people aren’t sanguine about the idea of an “in-between place”; members of the LGBTQ community also reject bisexuals. This is uncomfortable, but true.\n\nLosing support networks was a theme of my high school years, but I would do it all again in a heartbeat. I have learned the value of friendship and who my truest friends are, and I have campaigned and fought against bullying and made a difference at my high school.

Did the teacher think such-and-such is the “correct” interpretation of a novel? You did, too, or you lost points.\n\nNone of that was true for Ms. Jackie Winters.

My grades were dependent on being backed up by rhetoric, sources, and logic, not by compliance. Due to this engagement, this was the most enjoyable English literature class I had, and I feel like my viewpoints were challenged. I learned to question my ideas and dig into a text for the best results.\n\nBest of all, I was putting in more and more effort to find good, quality sources to back up my arguments.

      "essay": "The three, small, purple seeds sat on the brown soil. Ten feet from me I could see my grandpa with his yunta and donkeys. They were in unison: the two donkeys, the plow, and him. My grandpa commanded; the donkeys obeyed. I began to feel tired. Exhausted. My neck was being pierced by the Mexican sun as I dropped seeds for hours.\n\nI can’t complain; I wanted to do this.\n\nI placed three tiny seeds, imagining the corn stalk growing while the pumpkin vines wrapped around it; both sprouting, trying to bear fruit. I clenched a fistful of dirt and placed it on them. “Más,” my grandpa told me as he quickly flooded the seeds with life-giving dirt.\n\nCovered. Completely trapped.\n\nMy grandfather has been doing this ever since he was a little boy. Fifty-five years later and he still works hard on the field. There isn’t much else to do in the small town of Temalac, Guerrero. All he could do was adapt; something my parents never did. They sacrificed everything and left their home, never to return again. With no knowledge of what would come tomorrow, with only their clothes on their backs, they immigrated to the US. They had to work on unknown soil, hoping their dedication will help sprout the new seeds they’d soon plant. They did this for me. They wanted me to worry about my education, not if there would be enough rain to satisfy the thirst of the crops.\n\nI have a thirst.\n\nA thirst to be the vessel for my family into a better future. I must be the crop that feeds them. All these thoughts rushed into my soul as I looked back down the aluminum bucket. I could never be a farmer. I’m grateful my parents were.\n\nThey planted a seed. A tiny seed with no instructions but to succeed. I’m the first-born son of two immigrant parents. I had a clean sheet to become anything. I could’ve fallen into my town’s influence, joined a gang, and become another statistic. Regardless of the dirt I come from, I began to sprout. Ever since I was eight years old I was entrusted with responsibilities. We were lucky that school was a three-minute walk; yet it was a stressful journey for a child. I had to wake up my brother, give him breakfast, make sure his clothes were ready, and that he was doing well in school.\n\nGrowing up, I always fell behind in school. I had to take summer classes to match my peers’ intellect; while others were reading to learn, I was merely learning to read. My parents weren’t able to teach me English; I grew up solely developing my Spanish accent. My bilingual brain hadn't yet matured and lacked the English tongue. Entrusting a child to be the translator-of-all-matters for his parents robs him of his childhood. I had to help my parents navigate an English system unknown to them. From the day I learned to speak I had to learn to advocate not just for myself, but for my parents.\n\nI’m the type of person my family tree hasn’t seen. Staying in high school, getting good grades, and being a responsible individual are aspects that make people around me think that I have sprouted. But I have not yet bloomed into the being I wish to become. In fact, I have merely tunneled my roots onto the Earth; roots that have been solidified by the determination my parents instilled in me as a child. Nothing I ever accomplished was handed to me. It’s the fact that I have come this far without the advantages other students have that fills me with pride.",

      "essay": "I spent much of my childhood watching movies. I became absolutely engrossed in many different films, TV shows, and animations. From the movie theatres to the TV, I spent my hours enjoying the beauty of visual media. One place that was special to me was the car. My parents purchased a special screen that could be mounted on the back of the headrest, so that I could watch movies on trips. This benefited both parties, as I was occupied, and they had peace. Looking back, I realize this screen played a crucial role in my childhood. It was an integral part of many journeys. I remember taking a drive to Washington D.C, with my visiting relatives from Poland, and spending my time with my eyes on the screen. I remember packing up my possessions and moving to my current home from Queens, watching my cartoons the whole time. I can comfortably say that watching movies in the car has been an familiar anchor during times of change in my life.\n\nI used to watch many different cartoons, nature documentaries, and other products in the car, yet there has been one movie that I have rewatched constantly. It is called “Kiki’s Delivery Service” by Hayao Miyazaki. My parents picked it up at a garage sale one day, and I fell in love. The style of the animations were beautiful, and the captivating story of a thirteen year old witch leaving home really appealed to me. To be honest, the initial times I watched it, I didn’t fully understand the story but the magic and beauty just made me happy. Then, the more I watched it, I began to see that it was more about independence, including the need to get away from home and establish yourself as your own person. This mirrors how I felt during that period of my life,with mehaving a little rebellious streak; I didn’t agree with my parents on certain topics. That is not the end of the story though. As the years passed, and I watched it a couple more times, although with less frequency than before, my view of this movie evolved yet again.\n\nInstead of solely thinking about the need for independence, I began to think the movie was more about the balance of independence and reliance. In the movie, the girl finds herself struggling until she begins to accept help from others. Looking back, this also follows my own philosophy during this time. As I began to mature, I began to realize the value of family, and accept all the help I can get from them. I appreciate all the hard work they had done for me, and I recognize their experience in life and take advantage of it. I passed through my rebellious phase, and this reflected in my analysis of the movie. I believe that this is common, and if I look through the rest of my life I am sure I would find other similar examples of my thoughts evolving based on the stage in my life. This movie is one of the most important to me throughout my life.",

      "essay": "It was a crisp fall morning. In the distance, the outlines of trees resembled people. Some were tall, slender, brown bodies; some with sparse green-yellow clothes, some naked, some with arms spread, some folded, some heads straight, and some hidden. I got out of the bed, stepped outside, and to my amazement, discovered these beautiful sticks laying in the grass. To most, they are just sticks, but to me, they were pieces of art.\n\nAs I went to pick one of the sticks up, I recognized the brilliance of this simple object that had fallen from those beautiful people-like trees. This small yet remarkable brown stick that fell from the branches of the tree was part of nature's way to renew life for the coming spring. On that brisk fall day, I picked up every stick that fell in the small backyard of my house and brought them inside. My mother was annoyed and immediately asked why I was bringing garbage into the house. But that didn't stop me. I had an idea, and I knew these sticks that she saw as garbage could be turned into something beautiful.\n\nI took those sticks into my room and placed them on my desk. I then took a small brush to gently remove the dirt and some of the bark that had started to decay. They were even more beautiful than I had first imagined. The next day, I asked my father to pick up a 3x4 shadow box frame at the local store and waited in anticipation until he arrived home. When I got that frame in my hands, I immediately started working on my computer desk, which I turned into a makeshift studio. As I carefully observed, no two sticks were alike, even though some fell from the same tree. The vivid image detailing the randomness of nature was sitting on my table. As I put sticks together in different patterns, I saw various shapes and I quickly recognized that I could use nature to create art. I opened the frame and began assembling the sticks in patterns that made sense to me. I closed the back of the frame, locked it, and felt my heart pumping to turn it over and see what I created. When I did it was beautiful! I had taken something that would typically be discarded and turned it into something worthy of being displayed on a wall – I had created art. That first piece of art still sits next to my bed, though I have created more shadow-box stick art since then. Some have been given as gifts to friends, but more importantly, some have been sold for a loftier goal.\n\nThe funds raised from selling these shadow boxes help to support a charity I have created. The charity is called Redacted, an umbrella 501(c) organization. Working in conjunction with Redacted Charity, a local non-profit, we are providing safe drinking water to women and children in developing, and underdeveloped countries. Being a young and impressionable woman spending many of my family vacations residing in my grandparent’s village, I know first-hand the struggle these women face daily to fetch basic clean drinking water for their families. Similar to how I gathered sticks to make art, I plan to continue gathering funds and resources to create change in these communities with need. Every autumn and beyond.",

      "essay": "The pitter patter of droplets, the sweet smell that permeates throughout the air, the dark grey clouds that fill the sky, shielding me from the otherwise intense gaze of the sun, create a landscape unparalleled by any natural beauty. I have gazed upon the towering cliffs of Yosemite, stood next to Niagara falls as the water roars, succumbing to the power of gravity, and seen the beaches of Mexico basked in moonlight, yet none of these wonders compares to the simple beauty of an Arizona rainstorm. To me, our rain represents more than humidity and darkness; its rarity gives it beauty. The uncertainty of when the next day of rain will come compels me to slow down, and enjoy the moment.\n\nOut of the three realms of time; past, present, and future, the present is the only one we can experience, and I take advantage of every moment I have. When I pause my running to enjoy a sunset that dazzles the sky with brilliant colors of purple and orange, when I touch my brush to a canvas and focus on my movements in the present, when I drive home after a long day of improving our robot, and decide to drive around my neighborhood to finish “Garota de Ipanema”, which just popped up from my playlist of 700 songs, I am taking advantage of the moment.\n\nSo next time it rains, step outside. Close your eyes. Hear the symphony of millions of water droplets. And enjoy the moment.",

In my dreams, I began a journey for my identity to discover the hidden stories within those songs. Perhaps that's what led me to explore Hindustani music. \"Sa-re-ga\" encodes my ancestors' songs just like \"do-re-mi.\" With this solfege, I began exploring a vocal part of my culture, collecting the keys to my identity.\n\nEach song I learned further educated me about myths and legends that helped form who I am today.\n\nWhen I face adversity in male-dominated activities, I remember Sita, who fought heroically in revolutionary conflicts hundreds of years ago. This has empowered me to believe in my talents and goals, whether I am doing research or organizing a STEM fair in my community. The character Arjuna, who became one of the best archers, taught me perseverance and a desire to learn from others. When chosen to fly to Denmark to play badminton with local clubs, I embraced this experience to play among outstanding competitors and to enhance my competitive abilities. As an Asian American, I am reminded by the Indian National Anthem that I am an American and an Indian.\n\nI plan to bring my music and stories with me to college. The keyboard in my Duke dorm will ring with strong Hindustani notes. I hope to share with my dorm mates and friends the history of those heroes and the strength I gleam from them every day.",

      "essay": "Embarrassment’s red glow covering my face matched the red ink circling the “44” grade atop my AP Biology exam on Photosynthesis and Cellular Respiration. I was devastated that day in Room 46.\n\nUntil then, Room 46 had been my magic school bus where we spent our time wandering wide-eyed through the world of science: dissecting pigs, testing our own DNA for the Alu insertion, and sharing community-creating laughs along the way. But receiving that “44” jarred me into feeling I didn’t belong there anymore. \n\nHowever, after meeting with my guidance counselor, contemplating dropping the class, and countless extra help sessions with my biology teacher, I realized my magic school bus journey wasn’t over yet, as I gradually concluded that my commitment to Room 46 was stronger than one bad test grade, that I was stronger than one bad test grade.\n\nThe journey was tricky and undoubtedly riddled with discouraging moments, but by applying myself and being resourceful, I made my “44” an isolated outlier before it was dropped from the gradebook entirely by semester’s end as my lowest grade. While my success can be quantified, it’s nonetheless my memory of Room 46 that’s continuously inspired me to transcend my limits and take on challenges even in areas of weakness (i.e. AP Bio). I consider this my best academic experience because it showed me what happens when you push past failure - success! - as I ended up getting an A in the class and a 5 on the AP test!",

      "essay": "I sat frozen on the stage. I was at my first major dance performance, at the 2010 Commonwealth Games Opening Ceremony, and my cue had come. Ten seconds passed, and I was still frozen. Twenty seconds. Thirty seconds. No movement.\n\nThis was my performance: keeping my body still as a statue. My role was to use subtle facial expressions to depict the guru-shishya (teacher-student) relationship sitting under the Tree of Knowledge.The piece depicted how teachers impart wisdom from the tree of knowledge to their students.\n\nWith a large bright-red tilak mark on her forehead, eyes outlined with black kohl and a body swathed in Sambhalpuri sarees, my guru brought a sense of other-worldliness to our institute (Shri Kamakhya Kalapeeth) for Indian Classical Dance Odissi. Her love of tradition was reflected in her teachings. For instance, she opposed the use of props and set decorations: if we dancers were truly embodying the story, our expressions and mudras would be enough. Our performances were not for mere entertainment; we served as cultural ambassadors. She never verbally complimented anyone. Approval was tacit, usually indicated by selection for some performance. Some students did not get a chance to perform for years.\n\nSurprisingly, I got my chance rather early. At the age of ten, I was one of the youngest to receive ghungaroos, which are anklets with metal bells that serve as vessels through which the guru confers a blessing onto the student. This was a pivotal point in my journey.\n\nAfter this, I started performing all over India. Whenever I stepped on stage, I got lost in the performance, and for those few moments nothing else mattered. At times, I was called on stage to play several characters in the same dance just through a change of expressions. I started to truly feel the power of pure Odissi to inhabit other characters, and other worlds.\n\nSo much of my energy went into dancing, I found myself involuntarily living dance – painting canvases with dance themes, practicing dance moves while taking phone calls, and even revising steps in my mind during long swim workouts. This was when I realised that Odissi was more than a hobby; it was my passion.\n\nOn my 15th birthday I received a gift I will cherish for life–my teacher booked an auditorium for my Rangapravesh: a debut solo-dance recital. The coming months were intense. I came home exhausted from rehearsals, but my tired feet ached to dance again.\n\nAs the practices got longer, my bond with my guru grew stronger. Then came the penultimate day of practice for my Rangapravesh. After completing one of my longest and toughest compositions, “Dashavatar”, I was going to change my sweat-soaked clothes when my teacher called me next to her. This was odd; usually I would simply be dismissed. With arms wide open she said, “I see my reflection in you.” Trembling, I went closer and hugged her. After nine years of training I had finally received my first compliment.\n\nEver since, I have felt inspired to carry forward the Odissi tradition. In order to preserve my guru’s legacy, I want to immortalize her dance style by using motion capture suits to transfer her movements onto robots. This way, people all over the world can experience the aura and magic of Odissi. Dance has no boundaries, and progressivism is how I perceive Odissi can be preserved. As I embark on university study abroad, I want to be in an environment that is not only engulfed with reverence for knowledge and tradition, but also where I can challenge ideas and craft my own style of teaching.\n\nDuring my dance journey I have learned that education does not emanate passively from a tree of knowledge, but takes hard work, self-motivation, dedicated teachers, and supportive resources.

I found peace living off only what was around me, enjoying what mother earth had to offer. As one of the Hopi proverbs reads, “time isn't used, it's experienced” and how we chose to experience it, shapes our lives.\n\nI learned to love soil and all its nourishing qualities, the joy of falling asleep under the stars and celebrating a native culture centuries old. My family’s summer tradition of leaving modern technology behind lead me to a life of appreciation and thankfulness without the influence of the digital world.
